# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Systemic endotoxemia occurs in endometriosis-SIBO patients due to bacterial translocation

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Systemic endotoxemia represents a critical mechanistic link in the proposed endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway, arising through bacterial translocation across compromised intestinal barriers. In endometriosis patients with concurrent SIBO, chronic inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) compromise tight junction proteins including claudin-1 and occludin, leading to increased intestinal permeability. This "leaky gut" phenomenon allows gram-negative bacterial endotoxins, particularly lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to translocate from the intestinal lumen into systemic circulation. The inflammatory milieu created by ectopic endometrial implants further exacerbates this process through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) upregulation, which directly degrades intestinal barrier integrity.

Once in systemic circulation, bacterial endotoxins trigger profound immune activation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MyD88-dependent pathways in hepatic Kupffer cells, splenic macrophages, and circulating monocytes. This activation initiates a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokine release, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, while simultaneously activating the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcriptional pathway. The sustained cytokine storm creates a state of chronic systemic inflammation that extends beyond the original pelvic inflammatory focus, establishing multiple positive feedback loops that amplify both local endometriotic inflammation and systemic immune dysregulation.

The systemic endotoxemic state directly supports the global thesis by serving as the crucial inflammatory bridge between localized endometriosis and subsequent neuroendocrine disruption. Circulating endotoxins and their associated cytokine cascade suppress hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis, impair pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responsiveness, and inhibit peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism through type-1 deiodinase (DIO1) suppression. Simultaneously, chronic endotoxemia activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis while inducing glucocorticoid resistance, creating a state of metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation. This systemic inflammatory burden ultimately manifests as the constellation of symptoms characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome, including profound exhaustion, cognitive dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise, thereby completing the pathophysiological cascade from endometriosis to chronic fatigue.
