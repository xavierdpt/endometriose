# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** T4 to T3 conversion is impaired in endometriosis patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The impairment of T4 to T3 conversion in endometriosis patients represents a critical downstream consequence of the chronic inflammatory cascade initiated by ectopic endometrial tissue. Chronic systemic inflammation, mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, directly inhibits the activity of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1), the primary enzyme responsible for peripheral T4 to T3 conversion in hepatic and renal tissues. This inflammatory suppression of DIO1 activity occurs through multiple mechanisms: cytokine-mediated downregulation of DIO1 gene expression, decreased availability of selenium cofactors due to inflammatory oxidative stress, and direct enzymatic inhibition by inflammatory mediators. Additionally, the concurrent elevation of type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) activity in inflammatory states accelerates the conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive metabolite, further depleting the pool of substrate available for active T3 production.

The bacterial endotoxemia resulting from SIBO-associated intestinal permeability compounds this thyroidal dysfunction through hepatic Kupffer cell activation and subsequent inflammatory mediator release. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial products trigger toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathways, leading to NF-κB activation and enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines that further suppress DIO1 activity. Simultaneously, the inflammatory milieu promotes cortisol resistance and HPA axis dysregulation, creating a state where elevated cortisol levels paradoxically coexist with impaired glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. This cortisol-resistant state prevents the normal suppressive effects of cortisol on inflammatory cytokine production while maintaining cortisol's inhibitory effects on TSH secretion and peripheral T4 to T3 conversion, creating a particularly detrimental metabolic environment.

The resulting state of functional hypothyroidism, characterized by normal or elevated T4 levels but decreased T3 availability, directly contributes to the metabolic suppression and chronic fatigue phenotype described in the global thesis. Reduced T3 availability impairs mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, decreases basal metabolic rate, and compromises cellular energy production across multiple organ systems. This metabolic suppression creates a self-perpetuating cycle where decreased cellular energy availability impairs immune function and tissue repair mechanisms, potentially exacerbating the underlying endometriotic inflammatory process and maintaining the pathological state. The T4 to T3 conversion impairment thus represents both a consequence of the endometriosis-SIBO inflammatory cascade and a contributing factor to the chronic fatigue syndrome phenotype, positioning it as a critical therapeutic target in the integrated management approach required for this complex pathophysiological network.
