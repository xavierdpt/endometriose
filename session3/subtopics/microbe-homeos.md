# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Host-microbe homeostasis is disrupted in endometriosis leading to bacterial translocation

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriosis fundamentally disrupts host-microbe homeostasis through multiple interconnected mechanisms that compromise intestinal barrier integrity and promote pathological bacterial translocation. The chronic inflammatory state characteristic of endometriosis generates sustained elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which directly impair tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) that maintain intestinal epithelial barrier function. Simultaneously, the inflammatory milieu activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9, which degrade extracellular matrix components and further compromise mucosal integrity. This inflammatory assault on the intestinal barrier creates increased intestinal permeability, commonly referred to as "leaky gut syndrome," which allows normally contained bacterial components and metabolites to traverse the epithelial barrier and enter systemic circulation.

The disruption of host-microbe homeostasis in endometriosis extends beyond simple barrier dysfunction to encompass fundamental alterations in microbial composition and metabolic activity. Chronic inflammation and altered immune surveillance create selective pressures that favor the expansion of pathogenic bacterial strains, particularly gram-negative species that produce high levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin. Concurrently, the inflammatory environment suppresses beneficial commensal bacteria, including short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing species such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which normally maintain epithelial integrity and immune homeostasis. This dysbiotic shift toward pro-inflammatory bacterial populations, combined with compromised barrier function, facilitates the translocation of bacterial antigens, LPS, and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) across the intestinal mucosa, triggering systemic immune activation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MyD88-dependent signaling pathways.

The resulting bacterial translocation creates a self-perpetuating cycle of systemic inflammation that directly supports the progression from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through multiple downstream pathophysiological mechanisms. Translocated LPS activates hepatic Kupffer cells and peripheral macrophages, generating additional waves of inflammatory cytokine release that suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function by inhibiting thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3 through cytokine-mediated suppression of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1). Furthermore, chronic endotoxemia promotes hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation through sustained cortisol elevation and subsequent glucocorticoid receptor desensitization, while bacterial-derived metabolites and inflammatory mediators cross the blood-brain barrier to activate microglia and induce neuroinflammation. This cascade of endotoxin-driven systemic inflammation thus provides the critical mechanistic link between endometriosis-associated microbiome disruption and the metabolic suppression, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and chronic fatigue that characterize the complete pathophysiological pathway.
