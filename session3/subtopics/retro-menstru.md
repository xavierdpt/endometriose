# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Retrograde menstruation is the primary mechanism for ectopic endometrial tissue dissemination

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Retrograde menstruation serves as the foundational mechanism initiating the pathophysiological cascade described in our global thesis by facilitating the transport of viable endometrial tissue through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity. During menstruation, fragments of functional endometrial tissue, including glandular epithelium and stromal cells, are propelled retrograde through the fallopian tubes due to increased intrauterine pressure and impaired cervical drainage. These displaced endometrial fragments retain their hormonal responsiveness, particularly to estrogen and progesterone, and their capacity for inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Upon peritoneal implantation, these ectopic tissues establish autonomous inflammatory foci that continuously release pro-inflammatory mediators, creating a state of chronic pelvic inflammation that extends beyond the reproductive system to influence gastrointestinal and systemic immune function.

The biochemical signature of retrograde menstruation-induced endometriosis involves the activation of key inflammatory pathways that directly contribute to the development of SIBO and subsequent systemic complications. Ectopic endometrial implants express elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and aromatase (CYP19A1), leading to increased local production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and estrone/17β-estradiol. This localized hormonal dysregulation activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which amplifies the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as MCP-1, IL-8, and RANTES. The chronic inflammatory environment created by these implants disrupts normal enteric nervous system function through cytokine-mediated interference with vagal and sympathetic nerve signaling, leading to impaired gastrointestinal motility, delayed gastric emptying, and small bowel stasis - conditions that directly predispose to bacterial overgrowth and SIBO development.

The perpetuation of inflammation through retrograde menstruation-established endometriotic lesions creates a self-reinforcing cycle that amplifies the pathophysiological progression toward chronic fatigue syndrome. Monthly episodes of retrograde menstruation continuously seed new endometrial implants while existing lesions undergo cyclic bleeding and healing, generating persistent inflammatory stimuli through the release of hemoglobin-derived iron, which promotes oxidative stress via Fenton chemistry and lipid peroxidation. This chronic inflammatory burden overwhelms regulatory T-cell (Foxp3+ Tregs) function and promotes immune exhaustion, characterized by reduced IL-10 production and increased Th17 cell differentiation. The resulting immune dysregulation facilitates bacterial translocation across compromised intestinal barriers, leading to endotoxemia and hepatic Kupffer cell activation, which ultimately suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis through cytokine-mediated inhibition of TRH release and peripheral deiodinase activity, culminating in the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences that characterize chronic fatigue syndrome.
