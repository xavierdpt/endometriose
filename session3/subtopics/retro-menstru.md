# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Retrograde menstruation is the primary mechanism for ectopic endometrial tissue dissemination

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Retrograde menstruation serves as the foundational mechanism initiating the pathophysiological cascade described in our global thesis by facilitating the transport of viable endometrial tissue through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity. During menstruation, fragments of functional endometrial tissue, including glandular epithelium and stromal cells, are propelled retrograde through the fallopian tubes due to increased intrauterine pressure and impaired cervical drainage. These displaced endometrial fragments retain their hormonal responsiveness, particularly to estrogen and progesterone, and their capacity for inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Upon peritoneal implantation, these ectopic tissues establish autonomous inflammatory foci that continuously release pro-inflammatory mediators, creating a state of chronic pelvic inflammation that extends beyond the reproductive system to influence gastrointestinal and systemic immune function.

The biochemical signature of retrograde menstruation-induced endometriosis involves the activation of key inflammatory pathways that directly contribute to the development of SIBO and subsequent systemic complications. Ectopic endometrial implants express elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and aromatase (CYP19A1), leading to increased local production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and estrone/17β-estradiol. This localized hormonal dysregulation activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which amplifies the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as MCP-1, IL-8, and RANTES. The chronic inflammatory environment created by these implants disrupts normal enteric nervous system function through cytokine-mediated interference with vagal and sympathetic nerve signaling, leading to impaired gastrointestinal motility, delayed gastric emptying, and small bowel stasis - conditions that directly predispose to bacterial overgrowth and SIBO development.

The perpetuation of inflammation through retrograde menstruation-established endometriotic lesions creates a self-reinforcing cycle that amplifies the pathophysiological progression toward chronic fatigue syndrome. Monthly episodes of retrograde menstruation continuously seed new endometrial implants while existing lesions undergo cyclic bleeding and healing, generating persistent inflammatory stimuli through the release of hemoglobin-derived iron, which promotes oxidative stress via Fenton chemistry and lipid peroxidation. This chronic inflammatory burden overwhelms regulatory T-cell (Foxp3+ Tregs) function and promotes immune exhaustion, characterized by reduced IL-10 production and increased Th17 cell differentiation. The resulting immune dysregulation facilitates bacterial translocation across compromised intestinal barriers, leading to endotoxemia and hepatic Kupffer cell activation, which ultimately suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis through cytokine-mediated inhibition of TRH release and peripheral deiodinase activity, culminating in the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences that characterize chronic fatigue syndrome.

# Literature Review

## Reference 1

**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10001466

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review provides substantial support for retrograde menstruation as a primary mechanism while highlighting important limitations that contextualize our global thesis. The reference confirms that Sampson's retrograde menstruation theory, established in 1925, demonstrates how menstrual blood containing viable endometrial cells regurgitates through patent fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity, where implantation and subsequent angiogenesis-supported development occur through activated peritoneal macrophages producing VEGF. However, the review presents critical nuancing evidence: 76-90% of women experience physiological retrograde menstruation without developing endometriosis, suggesting that additional factors beyond simple retrograde flow are required for pathogenesis. The reference identifies key risk factors that align with our pathophysiological analysis—short menstrual cycles, prolonged menstrual flow, and uterine outflow obstruction—which increase the quantity of retrogradely displaced endometrial cells and subsequent inflammatory burden. While the theory adequately explains superficial peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis consistent with our inflammatory cascade model, the review acknowledges limitations in explaining deep infiltrating endometriosis or extra-pelvic lesions, supporting our integrated multi-pathway approach. The baboon model studies referenced demonstrate correlation between retrograde menstruation and endometriosis development but confirm that retrograde menstruation alone is insufficient, reinforcing our thesis that the retrograde menstruation-SIBO-systemic inflammation pathway requires multiple pathophysiological amplifications to progress toward chronic fatigue syndrome manifestation.

## Reference 2

**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16990031

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Ulukus et al. provides critical support for retrograde menstruation as a foundational mechanism while emphasizing the multi-factorial nature essential to our pathophysiological analysis. The authors confirm Sampson's retrograde menstruation theory, demonstrating how endometrial cells reflux through fallopian tubes during menstruation and implant onto peritoneum and pelvic organs, directly validating the initial step in our proposed cascade. However, the review's most significant contribution lies in highlighting that retrograde menstruation alone is insufficient for endometriosis development, requiring additional pathophysiological amplifications exactly as described in our global thesis linking endometriosis to SIBO and systemic inflammation. The authors identify crucial molecular differences in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis, including invasive properties, decreased apoptosis, altered gene and protein expression, and critically, increased steroid and cytokine production—biochemical alterations that directly correspond to our analysis of COX-2 upregulation, aromatase expression, and NF-κB pathway activation. The review's emphasis on the inflammatory peritoneal environment creating biochemical differences between ectopic and eutopic endometrium strongly supports our mechanistic description of how chronic inflammatory foci established through retrograde menstruation generate the cytokine-mediated disruption of enteric nervous system function and gastrointestinal motility that predisposes to SIBO development and subsequent systemic inflammatory amplification toward chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Reference 3

**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11277188

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive 2024 review strongly reinforces our pathophysiological analysis by confirming Sampson's retrograde menstruation theory as a widely accepted major contributor to endometriosis development while emphasizing the multi-factorial complexity essential to our global thesis. The authors validate the fundamental mechanism whereby endometrial tissue fragments are regurgitated through fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity during menstruation, directly supporting our proposed initiating step in the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue cascade. Critically, the review acknowledges that retrograde menstruation alone is insufficient for pathogenesis, requiring additional pathophysiological amplifications exactly as described in our integrated model linking chronic inflammatory processes to systemic complications. The reference provides substantial molecular support for our biochemical pathway analysis, detailing how established endometriotic lesions maintain hormonal responsiveness and continuously produce inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α through dysregulated estrogen signaling and NF-κB pathway activation. The authors' emphasis on chronic inflammatory burden, immune dysregulation, and the role of cytokine-mediated tissue damage directly parallels our mechanistic description of how retrograde menstruation-established inflammatory foci create the persistent immune activation that disrupts gastrointestinal function and promotes bacterial overgrowth. Furthermore, the review's discussion of genomic and epigenetic alterations in endometriotic tissue, including enhanced aromatase expression and cytokine production, provides molecular validation for the self-reinforcing inflammatory cycles we describe as progressing toward metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Reference 4

**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12113382

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive 2025 narrative review provides exceptional validation for our integrated pathophysiological model by confirming retrograde menstruation as a widely accepted initiating mechanism while extensively documenting the precise gut microbiota alterations and systemic inflammatory cascades described in our global thesis linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. The authors validate Sampson's retrograde menstruation theory as a foundational mechanism while emphasizing the multi-factorial complexity essential to disease progression, directly supporting our analysis that retrograde menstruation alone requires additional pathophysiological amplifications to manifest the full endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue cascade. Most significantly, this reference provides detailed molecular evidence for the gut dysbiosis component of our pathway, demonstrating how endometriosis patients exhibit reduced beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcaceae) and increased pro-inflammatory taxa (Escherichia/Shigella, Streptococcus, Bacteroides), creating the precise microbial environment we describe as predisposing to SIBO development. The review's description of the "gut-immune-endometriosis axis" directly parallels our mechanistic analysis, detailing how gut microbiota dysbiosis leads to compromised intestinal barrier integrity, allowing bacterial endotoxins (LPS) to enter systemic circulation and activate TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, triggering chronic inflammatory responses through macrophage activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6). Furthermore, the authors' documentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in endometriosis patients, including motility disorders that predispose to bacterial overgrowth, provides clinical validation for the enteric nervous system dysfunction we describe as the critical link between chronic pelvic inflammation and SIBO development, ultimately supporting our integrated model of how retrograde menstruation-established inflammatory foci progress toward the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Reference 5

**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12771450

**Assessment:**

This critical analysis presents important challenges to retrograde menstruation as a primary mechanism while paradoxically strengthening our global thesis by highlighting the multi-factorial complexity required for endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue progression. The authors' rigorous examination reveals fundamental limitations in Sampson's theory, demonstrating that microscopic endometriosis is exceptionally rare despite widespread acceptance in clinical practice, and critically noting the absence of evidence that endometrial cells present in peritoneal fluid can attach to and invade autologous pelvic peritoneum. These findings challenge the direct implantation mechanism central to traditional retrograde menstruation theory while supporting our analysis that retrograde menstruation alone is insufficient for pathogenesis and requires additional pathophysiological amplifications exactly as described in our integrated model. The authors' observation that endometrial cells are "rather infrequently present in peritoneal fluid" during menstruation contradicts simplistic retrograde theories but aligns with our thesis requirement for multiple concurrent factors—including the chronic inflammatory environment, immune dysregulation, and bacterial translocation mechanisms we describe as essential for progression toward SIBO and systemic complications. Most significantly for our pathophysiological analysis, the authors' acknowledgment that "large fragments of endometrial tissue" may still "implant onto pelvic peritoneum immediately after retrograde menstruation" supports our mechanistic description of how substantial tissue deposits, rather than individual cells, establish the autonomous inflammatory foci capable of producing the persistent cytokine burden, COX-2 upregulation, and NF-κB pathway activation required to disrupt enteric nervous system function and create the gastrointestinal motility disorders that predispose to bacterial overgrowth. The reference's emphasis on the need for "more research to evaluate the quantity and quality of endometrial cells and fragments" reinforces our integrated approach recognizing that retrograde menstruation represents one component of a complex multi-pathway cascade requiring bacterial dysbiosis, immune exhaustion, and metabolic suppression to manifest the chronic fatigue syndrome endpoint described in our global thesis.

## Reference 6

**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6888544

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive 2019 review by Lagana et al. provides exceptional molecular-level validation for our integrated pathophysiological model by confirming retrograde menstruation as a widely accepted foundational mechanism while extensively documenting the precise hormonal dysregulation and inflammatory cascades that connect endometriosis to the systemic complications described in our global thesis. The authors strongly support Sampson's retrograde menstruation theory, demonstrating that 76-90% of women experience tubal reflux of viable endometrial tissue during menstruation, directly validating the initiating mechanism in our proposed endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue cascade. Most significantly for our biochemical pathway analysis, this reference provides detailed molecular evidence for the key inflammatory mediators we identify as driving systemic dysfunction: the review documents how established endometriotic lesions exhibit dysregulated estrogen signaling through aromatase (CYP19A1) overexpression and 17β-HSD type 2 deficiency, leading to elevated local estradiol concentrations that activate the precise COX-2/PGE2 positive feedback loops we describe as amplifying inflammation. The authors' documentation of chronic peritoneal inflammation through TNF-α, IL-1β, and NF-κB pathway activation directly supports our mechanistic description of how retrograde menstruation-established inflammatory foci generate the cytokine-mediated disruption of enteric nervous system function that predisposes to SIBO development. Furthermore, the review's emphasis on tissue injury and repair (TIAR) mechanisms, chronic inflammatory burden, and the role of activated peritoneal macrophages in VEGF production provides molecular validation for the persistent immune activation we describe as progressing toward the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome, while the authors' acknowledgment that retrograde menstruation alone is insufficient for pathogenesis reinforces our thesis requirement for additional pathophysiological amplifications through bacterial overgrowth and systemic inflammatory dysregulation.
