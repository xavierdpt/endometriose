# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Elevated cortisol dampens thyroid hormone synthesis in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The chronic inflammatory state characteristic of endometriosis activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through persistent elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. This cytokine-mediated HPA activation stimulates corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from the hypothalamus and subsequent adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the anterior pituitary, ultimately driving sustained cortisol hypersecretion from the adrenal cortex. The elevated cortisol levels create a state of chronic glucocorticoid excess that directly suppresses thyroid hormone synthesis through multiple mechanisms: inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) gene expression in the hypothalamus, suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the anterior pituitary, and direct interference with thyroidal hormone production pathways.

At the peripheral level, chronic cortisol elevation disrupts thyroid hormone metabolism by inhibiting type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in hepatocytes and other peripheral tissues, reducing the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the metabolically active triiodothyronine (T3). Simultaneously, cortisol enhances type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) expression, which preferentially converts T4 to reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive metabolite that competitively inhibits T3 action at thyroid hormone receptors. This enzymatic dysregulation creates a state of peripheral thyroid hormone resistance despite potentially normal serum T4 levels, characterized by reduced free T3 availability and elevated rT3 concentrations, effectively dampening thyroidal metabolic signaling throughout the body.

This cortisol-mediated suppression of thyroid function represents a critical mechanistic link in the proposed endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway, as the resulting hypothyroid-like state directly contributes to the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences outlined in the global thesis. The reduced thyroidal metabolic drive compounds the energy deficit already established by SIBO-induced systemic inflammation and endotoxemia, while the perpetuation of HPA axis dysregulation maintains the pathological cycle. Furthermore, the interaction between elevated cortisol and suppressed thyroid function creates a bidirectional reinforcement loop, where thyroidal hypofunction further impairs HPA axis recovery and glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity, establishing a self-perpetuating neuroendocrine dysfunction that underlies the chronic fatigue phenotype observed in endometriosis patients.

# Literature Review

## Reference 1

**URL:** https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003177

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review provides robust mechanistic and clinical evidence that strongly supports the pathophysiological analysis of cortisol-mediated thyroid suppression. The authors present extensive data from multiple clinical studies demonstrating that hypercortisolism consistently reduces TSH secretion and pulse amplitude in Cushing's syndrome patients, with TSH levels showing inverse correlation with cortisol concentrations. Crucially, the paper validates the specific biochemical pathways outlined in the analysis: glucocorticoid receptor expression in TRH-secreting hypothalamic neurons leads to suppressed TRH gene expression, while direct pituitary effects include TSH inhibition via annexin 1-mediated paracrine mechanisms and enhanced somatostatin release. The peripheral mechanisms described precisely match the analysis, confirming that hypercortisolism inhibits type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity while enhancing type 3 deiodinase (DIO3), resulting in preferential conversion of T4 to inactive reverse T3 rather than metabolically active T3. Multiple prospective and retrospective studies cited demonstrate reversible central hypothyroidism in 31-53% of patients, with recovery occurring within 8 months after cortisol normalization, validating the bidirectional nature of the cortisol-thyroid interaction described in the endometriosis pathway model.

## Reference 2

**URL:** https://apmcfmu.com/index.php/apmc/article/view/1581

**Assessment:**

This cross-sectional clinical study provides direct empirical evidence strongly supporting the cortisol-thyroid suppression mechanism outlined in the pathophysiological analysis. The research demonstrates significantly elevated cortisol levels (27.25±3.27) in endometriosis patients compared to healthy controls (11.19±4.18), confirming chronic HPA axis activation in endometriosis as proposed in the analysis. Crucially, the study validates the predicted downstream thyroidal suppression, showing substantially reduced TSH levels in endometriosis patients (1.02±0.168mIU/L) versus controls (3.08±1.090 mIU/L), which directly supports the hypothesized cortisol-mediated inhibition of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function. The observed thyroid hormone profile further corroborates the peripheral deiodinase dysregulation described in the analysis, with endometriosis patients showing altered T4/T3 ratios characterized by increased T4 production but decreased T3 levels, consistent with impaired peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion via suppressed DIO1 activity. While the study's cross-sectional design limits causal inference and the sample size is relatively modest (n=55 patients, n=15 controls), the biochemical findings provide compelling clinical validation of the proposed mechanistic pathway linking endometriosis-induced cortisol elevation to thyroidal dysfunction, supporting the affirmation that elevated cortisol dampens thyroid hormone synthesis in endometriosis patients.

## Reference 3

**URL:** https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/17/8574

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review provides strong mechanistic support for the cortisol-thyroid suppression pathway by elucidating the microbiome-immune-endocrine (MIE) axis as an upstream contributor to the proposed mechanism. The authors demonstrate that dysbiosis can trigger chronic low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, and thyroid disturbances through disruption of the reproductive-hormonal axis, which directly supports the pathophysiological framework outlined in the analysis. Crucially, the paper validates that gut bacteriome imbalances can affect cortisol production through the gut-brain axis, leading to overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with downstream suppression of gonadal function and fertility. The review specifically confirms that psychological stress and inflammatory dysbiosis activate the HPA axis, raising cortisol levels through enhanced corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) signaling, which precisely matches the cytokine-mediated HPA activation described in endometriosis. Additionally, the authors establish that microbiome-derived metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids, can modulate immunoregulatory effects and inflammatory processes involved in conditions including endometriosis, providing mechanistic validation for how endometriosis-associated gut dysbiosis could amplify the chronic inflammatory state that drives sustained cortisol elevation and subsequent thyroidal suppression described in the primary analysis.

**URL:** https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/ijms/ijms-24-00310/article_deploy/ijms-24-00310.pdf?version=1671877042

**Assessment:**

This controlled clinical study presents evidence that directly contradicts the central premise of cortisol-mediated thyroid suppression outlined in the pathophysiological analysis, demonstrating significantly reduced rather than elevated cortisol levels in endometriosis patients. Sabbadin et al. found that morning plasma cortisol was substantially lower in women with minimal or mild pelvic endometriosis compared to healthy controls (0.257 ± 0.051 vs. 0.399 ± 0.065 μmol/L, p < 0.0001), indicating relative hypocortisolism rather than the hypercortisolism proposed in the analysis. The authors interpret this finding as a possible adaptive response to chronic stress associated with endometriosis, representing dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that may promote increased vulnerability to autoimmune disorders and inflammation due to inadequate cortisol availability. However, the study acknowledges conflicting evidence in the literature, noting that other investigations have documented elevated cortisol levels in endometriosis patients as an appropriate stress response, and suggests that these discrepancies may relate to disease stage, duration, severity, or previous treatments. While this study challenges the proposed cortisol elevation mechanism, it validates the broader concept of HPA axis dysfunction in endometriosis and raises important questions about whether the cortisol-thyroid suppression pathway may be stage-specific or represent a biphasic response pattern, with initial hypercortisolism potentially transitioning to hypocortisolism in chronic disease states.

## Reference 5

**URL:** https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/14/Suppl_3/257/2914569

**Assessment:**

This controlled clinical study presents evidence that partially contradicts the systemic cortisol elevation hypothesis while revealing important tissue-specific glucocorticoid dysregulation in endometriosis. Keay et al. demonstrated significantly reduced total cortisol concentrations in preovulatory follicular fluid from women with minor endometriosis compared to tubal infertility controls (258 vs 328 nmol/L, p < 0.02), indicating localized cortisol deficiency at the ovarian level despite the broader pathophysiological framework suggesting systemic hypercortisolism. This finding introduces a critical nuance to the proposed cortisol-thyroid suppression mechanism, suggesting that endometriosis may involve compartmentalized glucocorticoid dysregulation rather than uniform systemic elevation. The reduced follicular cortisol levels may reflect impaired local steroidogenesis through disrupted 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) enzyme activity, which could paradoxically coexist with systemic HPA axis hyperactivation and peripheral cortisol elevation as described in the primary analysis. While this localized cortisol reduction does not directly negate the proposed thyroidal suppression pathway, it highlights the complexity of glucocorticoid metabolism in endometriosis and suggests that the cortisol-mediated mechanisms may vary by tissue compartment, disease stage, and severity, potentially explaining some of the conflicting evidence in the literature regarding cortisol levels in endometriosis patients.

**URL:** https://karger.com/goi/article-abstract/42/3/183/151033/PRL-TSH-and-Their-Response-to-the-TRH-Test-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext

**Assessment:**

This controlled study of 10 endometriosis patients provides evidence that challenges the proposed cortisol-mediated thyroid suppression mechanism by demonstrating preserved or even enhanced hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis responsiveness. Matalliotakis et al. found no statistically significant changes in basal TSH levels during danazol treatment for endometriosis, which contradicts the expected TSH suppression proposed in the cortisol-thyroid dampening hypothesis. More significantly, the TRH stimulation test revealed significantly higher TSH responses during danazol treatment compared to before or after treatment, indicating enhanced rather than suppressed pituitary thyroid responsiveness when the axis is challenged. This enhanced TSH responsiveness to TRH stimulation suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis maintains its functional integrity in endometriosis patients, potentially contradicting the proposed cortisol-mediated suppression of TRH gene expression and pituitary TSH release outlined in the pathophysiological analysis. However, the study's limitations include its small sample size (n=10) and focus on danazol-treated patients rather than untreated endometriosis, which may confound interpretation since danazol itself can influence hormonal pathways independently of the endometriosis-cortisol-thyroid mechanism proposed in the primary analysis.

# Synthesis and Conclusions

## Substantiated Claims

**Mechanistic Pathways for Cortisol-Thyroid Interaction:** The proposed biochemical mechanisms linking cortisol elevation to thyroid suppression are strongly substantiated by Reference 1, which provides comprehensive validation of the specific pathways outlined in the analysis. The reference confirms that hypercortisolism suppresses TRH gene expression in hypothalamic neurons, inhibits TSH secretion via annexin 1-mediated mechanisms, and disrupts peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism by inhibiting type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) while enhancing type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) activity, leading to preferential conversion of T4 to inactive reverse T3.

**Upstream Inflammatory Activation:** Reference 3 provides robust support for the proposed inflammatory cascade, validating that chronic inflammation can activate the HPA axis through the gut-brain axis, leading to elevated cortisol levels via enhanced CRH and ACTH signaling. This confirms the mechanistic link between endometriosis-associated inflammation and HPA axis hyperactivation.

## Contradicted Claims

**Systemic Cortisol Elevation in Endometriosis:** The central premise of sustained cortisol hypersecretion faces significant contradiction from multiple references. Reference 4 directly challenges this claim by demonstrating substantially reduced morning plasma cortisol levels in endometriosis patients (0.257 ± 0.051 vs. 0.399 ± 0.065 μmol/L in controls), suggesting relative hypocortisolism rather than hypercortisolism. This finding indicates that the proposed cortisol-mediated thyroid suppression mechanism may not apply universally to endometriosis patients.

**Thyroid Axis Suppression:** Reference 6 contradicts the predicted thyroid axis suppression by demonstrating preserved or enhanced hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid responsiveness in endometriosis patients, with significantly higher TSH responses to TRH stimulation during treatment, suggesting maintained functional integrity of the thyroid axis rather than the proposed cortisol-mediated suppression.

## Mixed Evidence

**Clinical Cortisol-Thyroid Relationship:** Reference 2 provides partial support by demonstrating both elevated cortisol and reduced TSH levels in endometriosis patients, which aligns with the proposed mechanism. However, this clinical validation is offset by the contradictory cortisol findings in References 4 and 5, creating conflicting evidence about the actual cortisol status in endometriosis patients.

**Tissue-Specific vs. Systemic Effects:** Reference 5 reveals important complexity by showing reduced cortisol levels in ovarian follicular fluid despite the proposed systemic hypercortisolism, suggesting compartmentalized glucocorticoid dysregulation that may vary by tissue type, disease stage, and severity.

## Lacking Evidence Requiring Additional Investigation

**Disease Stage and Duration Specificity:** The contradictory cortisol findings across references suggest that the proposed mechanism may be stage-specific or represent a biphasic response pattern, with potential transition from initial hypercortisolism to hypocortisolism in chronic disease states. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether cortisol levels vary with disease progression.

**Bidirectional Reinforcement Loop:** While the mechanistic basis for cortisol-thyroid interaction is well-supported, direct evidence for the proposed bidirectional reinforcement loop between thyroidal hypofunction and impaired HPA axis recovery requires additional investigation through longitudinal clinical studies.

**Peripheral Thyroid Hormone Resistance:** Although the deiodinase dysregulation pathways are mechanistically validated, direct measurement of tissue-level T3 availability and reverse T3 concentrations in endometriosis patients is needed to confirm the proposed peripheral thyroid hormone resistance state.

## Overall Assessment

The literature presents a complex and partially contradictory picture regarding cortisol-mediated thyroid suppression in endometriosis. While the underlying biochemical mechanisms are well-established and mechanistically sound, the clinical evidence reveals significant heterogeneity in cortisol levels among endometriosis patients. This suggests that the proposed pathway may apply to specific patient subgroups or disease stages rather than representing a universal mechanism. The conflicting evidence points to the need for more comprehensive studies that account for disease severity, duration, treatment status, and individual patient characteristics to determine when and in which patients cortisol-mediated thyroid suppression occurs as a component of the endometriosis-chronic fatigue pathway.

# Pathophysiological Analysis (Revised)

The relationship between endometriosis and thyroid function through cortisol-mediated mechanisms appears to be significantly more complex and heterogeneous than initially proposed. While chronic inflammation in endometriosis can activate the HPA axis through persistent elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), as validated by Reference 3's demonstration of gut-brain axis activation and microbiome-immune-endocrine interactions, the clinical evidence reveals substantial variability in cortisol responses among endometriosis patients. Rather than universal hypercortisolism, the literature indicates a biphasic or stage-dependent pattern, where some patients exhibit elevated cortisol levels (Reference 2: 27.25±3.27 vs 11.19±4.18 in controls) while others demonstrate relative hypocortisolism (Reference 4: 0.257±0.051 vs 0.399±0.065 μmol/L in controls), suggesting that HPA axis dysregulation may represent an adaptive response to chronic stress that varies with disease duration, severity, and individual patient characteristics.

The mechanistic pathways linking cortisol elevation to thyroid suppression remain biochemically sound and well-validated when hypercortisolism does occur. Reference 1 comprehensively confirms that elevated cortisol suppresses TRH gene expression in hypothalamic neurons, inhibits TSH secretion via annexin 1-mediated paracrine mechanisms, and disrupts peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism by inhibiting type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity while enhancing type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) expression. This enzymatic dysregulation preferentially converts T4 to inactive reverse T3 rather than metabolically active T3, creating peripheral thyroid hormone resistance despite potentially normal serum T4 levels. However, the clinical application of these mechanisms is complicated by evidence of tissue-specific glucocorticoid dysregulation (Reference 5: reduced follicular cortisol despite systemic inflammation) and preserved hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis responsiveness in some patients (Reference 6: enhanced TSH responses to TRH stimulation), indicating compartmentalized rather than uniform endocrine dysfunction.

The revised understanding suggests that cortisol-mediated thyroid suppression in endometriosis represents a conditional rather than universal pathway, likely dependent on disease stage, severity, treatment status, and individual patient factors that determine HPA axis response patterns. In patients who do develop sustained hypercortisolism, the established mechanisms of thyroidal suppression contribute to the metabolic dysfunction and energy deficit characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. However, in patients with hypocortisolism or preserved thyroid axis function, alternative pathways involving direct inflammatory cytokine effects on thyroid metabolism, tissue-specific hormone resistance, or other neuroendocrine mechanisms may predominate in the development of fatigue symptoms. This complexity underscores the need for personalized approaches to understanding endometriosis-associated fatigue that account for individual variations in stress response patterns and endocrine dysfunction profiles, rather than assuming a single mechanistic pathway applies to all patients.
