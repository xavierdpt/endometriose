# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Elevated cortisol dampens thyroid hormone synthesis in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The chronic inflammatory state characteristic of endometriosis activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through persistent elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. This cytokine-mediated HPA activation stimulates corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from the hypothalamus and subsequent adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the anterior pituitary, ultimately driving sustained cortisol hypersecretion from the adrenal cortex. The elevated cortisol levels create a state of chronic glucocorticoid excess that directly suppresses thyroid hormone synthesis through multiple mechanisms: inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) gene expression in the hypothalamus, suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the anterior pituitary, and direct interference with thyroidal hormone production pathways.

At the peripheral level, chronic cortisol elevation disrupts thyroid hormone metabolism by inhibiting type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in hepatocytes and other peripheral tissues, reducing the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the metabolically active triiodothyronine (T3). Simultaneously, cortisol enhances type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) expression, which preferentially converts T4 to reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive metabolite that competitively inhibits T3 action at thyroid hormone receptors. This enzymatic dysregulation creates a state of peripheral thyroid hormone resistance despite potentially normal serum T4 levels, characterized by reduced free T3 availability and elevated rT3 concentrations, effectively dampening thyroidal metabolic signaling throughout the body.

This cortisol-mediated suppression of thyroid function represents a critical mechanistic link in the proposed endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway, as the resulting hypothyroid-like state directly contributes to the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences outlined in the global thesis. The reduced thyroidal metabolic drive compounds the energy deficit already established by SIBO-induced systemic inflammation and endotoxemia, while the perpetuation of HPA axis dysregulation maintains the pathological cycle. Furthermore, the interaction between elevated cortisol and suppressed thyroid function creates a bidirectional reinforcement loop, where thyroidal hypofunction further impairs HPA axis recovery and glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity, establishing a self-perpetuating neuroendocrine dysfunction that underlies the chronic fatigue phenotype observed in endometriosis patients.
