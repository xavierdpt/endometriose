# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Blood-brain barrier is disrupted by systemic inflammation in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption represents a critical mechanistic link between the systemic inflammatory state generated by endometriosis and the eventual development of neuroinflammation that contributes to chronic fatigue syndrome. In endometriosis, ectopic endometrial implants continuously release pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α into the systemic circulation. When concurrent SIBO develops due to endometriosis-related gastrointestinal dysfunction, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and flagellin further amplify this systemic inflammatory burden through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and subsequent NF-κB pathway stimulation, creating a state of chronic low-grade endotoxemia that specifically targets the cerebral vasculature.

The sustained elevation of circulating pro-inflammatory mediators directly compromises BBB integrity through multiple convergent pathways. TNF-α and IL-1β activate brain microvascular endothelial cells, leading to downregulation of tight junction proteins including claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), while simultaneously upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) that degrade the extracellular matrix components of the neurovascular unit. Concurrently, bacterial endotoxins trigger complement activation and neutrophil adhesion to cerebral capillaries, releasing elastase and other proteolytic enzymes that further compromise barrier function. This process is amplified by oxidative stress, as systemically elevated cytokines induce nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in brain endothelial cells, generating peroxynitrite that damages tight junction complexes and increases paracellular permeability.

The compromised BBB creates a pathological gateway for peripheral inflammatory mediators to access the central nervous system, establishing neuroinflammation that directly supports the global thesis linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. Once systemic cytokines and bacterial endotoxins penetrate the BBB, they activate resident microglia through pattern recognition receptors, initiating a cascade of central inflammatory responses that include local production of IL-1β, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This neuroinflammatory state disrupts hypothalamic function, contributing to HPA axis dysregulation and impaired corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling, while also affecting hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function through central inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) release. The resulting neuroendocrine dysfunction, combined with direct cytokine-mediated effects on neuronal metabolism and neurotransmitter systems, creates the neurobiological foundation for the profound fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and systemic symptoms characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
