# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** SIBO in endometriosis patients leads to increased LPS and flagellin release from gram-negative bacteria

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriosis creates a pathophysiological environment that predisposes patients to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) through multiple interconnected mechanisms. The chronic inflammatory state characteristic of endometriosis, mediated by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, can directly impair gastrointestinal motility by disrupting the migrating motor complex (MMC) and reducing gastric acid production. Additionally, the physical presence of endometrial lesions within the pelvic cavity can create anatomical distortions and adhesions that mechanically compromise bowel function, while the associated chronic pain may lead to altered autonomic nervous system regulation of digestive processes.

When SIBO develops in this compromised gastrointestinal environment, the aberrant proliferation of gram-negative bacteria in the small intestine results in significantly increased production and release of bacterial endotoxins, particularly lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin. LPS, a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, acts as a potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells. Simultaneously, flagellin, the structural protein of bacterial flagella, triggers TLR5 activation. Both pathways converge on NF-κB signaling cascades, amplifying local and systemic inflammatory responses through increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and interferon-γ.

This LPS and flagellin-mediated inflammatory amplification creates a critical pathophysiological bridge between localized endometriosis and systemic metabolic dysfunction. The sustained elevation of these bacterial endotoxins promotes intestinal permeability through tight junction disruption (particularly involving claudin and occludin proteins), facilitating bacterial translocation and endotoxemia. This systemic endotoxin burden subsequently activates hepatic Kupffer cells and triggers the acute-phase response, elevating circulating inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory mediators can then cross-talk with neuroendocrine pathways, suppressing hypothalamic TRH release, blunting pituitary TSH responsiveness, and inhibiting peripheral thyroid hormone conversion through downregulation of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity, ultimately contributing to the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory state characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
