# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Free T3 levels are reduced in endometriosis due to conversion blockade

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The reduction in free T3 levels observed in endometriosis represents a critical mechanistic link in the pathophysiological cascade connecting endometriotic inflammation to metabolic suppression and chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic inflammatory processes characteristic of endometriosis, particularly the sustained elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, directly inhibit the activity of peripheral deiodinase enzymes, specifically type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) and type 2 deiodinase (DIO2). These enzymes are essential for the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the metabolically active triiodothyronine (T3). The cytokine-mediated suppression occurs through multiple pathways, including NF-κB activation, which downregulates deiodinase gene expression, and direct enzymatic inhibition through oxidative stress and inflammatory mediator interference with selenocysteine-dependent deiodinase function.

This conversion blockade creates a state of peripheral thyroid hormone resistance despite potentially normal TSH and T4 levels, contributing to what is termed "low T3 syndrome" or "sick euthyroid syndrome." The mechanism is further amplified by the potential presence of SIBO in endometriosis patients, where bacterial endotoxins (LPS) and flagellin can trigger additional inflammatory cascades through TLR4 and TLR5 activation, perpetuating cytokine release and further suppressing deiodinase activity. Additionally, the chronic inflammatory state promotes increased activity of type 3 deiodinase (DIO3), which converts T4 and T3 to inactive reverse T3 (rT3) and T2, respectively, creating a double mechanism of T3 depletion through both reduced production and increased degradation.

The resulting reduction in bioavailable T3 directly impacts cellular metabolism at the mitochondrial level, where T3 is essential for maintaining optimal ATP synthesis, oxygen consumption, and metabolic rate. Decreased T3 availability leads to reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and compromised cellular energy production, manifesting as the metabolic suppression and fatigue characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. This metabolic dysfunction further perpetuates the inflammatory cycle by impairing immune cell energy metabolism, reducing the effectiveness of regulatory T-cell function, and maintaining the chronic inflammatory state that initiated the thyroid hormone conversion blockade, thus creating a self-reinforcing pathological loop that supports the central thesis linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue through interconnected inflammatory and metabolic pathways.
