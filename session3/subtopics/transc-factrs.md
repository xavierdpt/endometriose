# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.
