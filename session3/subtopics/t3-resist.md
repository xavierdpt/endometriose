# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Central T3 receptor resistance develops in endometriosis patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Central T3 receptor resistance represents a critical downstream consequence of the chronic inflammatory cascade initiated by endometriosis and amplified by SIBO-mediated endotoxemia. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, directly interfere with thyroid hormone receptor (TR) function through multiple mechanisms. These cytokines activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways, which competitively inhibit TR-mediated transcription by interfering with co-activator recruitment and chromatin remodeling. Additionally, chronic inflammation promotes the expression of co-repressor proteins such as nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), which bind to thyroid hormone receptors and block their transcriptional activity even in the presence of adequate T3 levels.

The development of T3 receptor resistance is further exacerbated by oxidative stress and endotoxin-mediated cellular dysfunction. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria in SIBO activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). These oxidative species directly modify TR protein structure through post-translational modifications, including nitrosylation and oxidation of critical cysteine residues, rendering the receptors less responsive to T3 binding. Furthermore, chronic oxidative stress depletes cellular antioxidant systems, including selenium-dependent enzymes, which are essential cofactors for optimal thyroid hormone receptor function and cellular thyroid hormone metabolism.

This peripheral T3 receptor resistance creates a state of functional hypothyroidism at the tissue level, despite potentially normal or even elevated circulating T3 concentrations. The resulting impairment in T3-mediated gene transcription leads to decreased expression of key metabolic enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced thermogenesis. This metabolic suppression contributes directly to the chronic fatigue phenotype while simultaneously perpetuating the inflammatory cycle through impaired immune regulation and reduced clearance of inflammatory mediators. The T3 receptor resistance thus serves as a crucial mechanistic link between the upstream inflammatory processes of endometriosis-SIBO interaction and the downstream manifestations of chronic fatigue syndrome.
