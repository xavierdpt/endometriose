# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Endometriotic lesions trigger local inflammatory responses with IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α release

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriotic lesions represent ectopic endometrial tissue that undergoes cyclical hormonal stimulation, creating a persistent inflammatory microenvironment. The presence of these lesions triggers recognition by tissue-resident macrophages and dendritic cells, which initiate inflammatory cascades through pattern recognition receptor (PRR) activation and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling. This immune activation results in the coordinated release of key pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1β through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-6 via NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional pathways, and TNF-α through macrophage and T-helper cell activation. These cytokines establish a local inflammatory milieu that not only perpetuates lesion survival and growth but also creates the foundational inflammatory substrate necessary for systemic pathophysiological progression.

The systemic circulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α from endometriotic foci establishes a critical mechanistic link to gastrointestinal dysfunction within the proposed endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway. IL-1β directly compromises intestinal epithelial barrier integrity by downregulating tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin while simultaneously reducing gastric acid production and impairing gastric motility through vagal nerve modulation. TNF-α synergistically enhances intestinal permeability via MLCK-mediated tight junction disruption and promotes intestinal inflammation through epithelial NF-κB activation. IL-6 contributes to this gastrointestinal compromise by suppressing gastric emptying and small bowel transit time through enteric nervous system interference, while also promoting bacterial translocation across the compromised intestinal barrier. This cytokine-mediated gastrointestinal dysfunction creates the precise conditions necessary for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) development.

The establishment of SIBO through endometriosis-derived inflammatory signaling represents a pivotal amplification mechanism within the proposed pathophysiological cascade. SIBO-associated bacterial overgrowth leads to excessive lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, which, combined with the pre-existing IL-1β/IL-6/TNF-α-mediated intestinal hyperpermeability, facilitates systemic endotoxemia. This bacterial endotoxin translocation triggers Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in hepatic Kupffer cells and systemic immune cells, creating a secondary inflammatory wave that amplifies the original endometriotic cytokine signal. The resulting cytokine storm, now featuring both endometriotic and SIBO-derived inflammatory mediators, establishes the systemic inflammatory burden necessary to disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function through central TRH suppression, peripheral deiodinase inhibition, and thyroid hormone resistance mechanisms, ultimately precipitating the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
