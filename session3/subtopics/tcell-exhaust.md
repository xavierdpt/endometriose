# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** T-cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and CTLA-4 are elevated in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

T-cell exhaustion represents a critical immune dysregulation mechanism that directly supports the global thesis linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through systemic inflammatory amplification. In endometriosis, the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue creates a chronic inflammatory microenvironment characterized by persistent antigen presentation and repetitive immune stimulation. This chronic immune activation leads to progressive T-cell dysfunction, marked by elevated expression of immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4). These exhausted T-cells lose their effector functions, including cytokine production and proliferative capacity, while simultaneously upregulating inhibitory pathways that suppress immune responses.

The elevation of PD-1 and CTLA-4 markers in endometriosis creates a state of immune paralysis that perpetuates the inflammatory cascade central to the global thesis. Exhausted T-cells fail to provide adequate immune surveillance and regulatory control, allowing for unchecked inflammatory processes that can disrupt gastrointestinal barrier function and promote conditions favorable for SIBO development. The impaired T-cell functionality also compromises the immune system's ability to maintain proper microbial homeostasis in the gut, potentially allowing bacterial translocation and endotoxin release that further amplifies systemic inflammation. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where T-cell exhaustion both results from and contributes to the chronic inflammatory state.

Furthermore, T-cell exhaustion markers correlate with the neuroendocrine disruption described in the global thesis through inflammatory cytokine-mediated suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Exhausted T-cells produce altered cytokine profiles, including elevated IL-10 and reduced IFN-γ production, which can interfere with normal thyroid hormone metabolism and HPA axis function. The chronic inflammatory state maintained by dysfunctional immune responses contributes to peripheral thyroid hormone resistance and metabolic suppression, ultimately manifesting as the fatigue and energy dysfunction characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. This immune exhaustion phenotype thus represents a critical mechanistic link connecting endometriotic inflammation to systemic metabolic and neuroendocrine dysfunction.

**Assessment:**

This well-designed study by Głowacka et al. (2018) provides strong direct evidence supporting the elevation of PD-1 exhaustion markers in endometriosis, using flow cytometry analysis of 25 endometriosis patients versus 20 healthy controls. The researchers demonstrated significantly elevated frequencies of PD-1+ cells across all major lymphocyte populations: CD4+/PD-1+ T cells were nearly doubled in endometriosis patients (9.01 ± 4.75% in stages I-II and 12.36 ± 3.37% in stages III-IV) compared to controls (5.35 ± 1.54%), while CD8+/PD-1+ T cells showed even greater elevation (8.19 ± 3.76% in stages I-II and 10.40 ± 3.11% in stages III-IV) versus controls (3.60 ± 1.46%). Importantly, the study also revealed increased CD19+/PD-1+ B cells and elevated PD-L1+ expression across lymphocyte populations, with ROC analysis demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.936-0.988) for these markers in distinguishing endometriosis patients from controls. The evidence strongly aligns with the pathophysiological analysis by confirming that chronic inflammatory conditions in endometriosis drive progressive T-cell exhaustion through upregulation of inhibitory checkpoint receptors, creating the immune paralysis that perpetuates inflammatory cascades described in the global thesis. The stage-dependent increases in PD-1+ frequencies (higher in stages III-IV than I-II) support the concept that immune exhaustion progressively worsens with disease advancement, potentially contributing to the systemic inflammatory amplification that disrupts gastrointestinal barrier function and promotes the SIBO-endometriosis pathophysiological cascade leading to metabolic and neuroendocrine dysfunction characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Assessment:**

This study provides mixed but important evidence regarding soluble immune checkpoint molecules in endometriosis, offering a nuanced perspective on the T-cell exhaustion hypothesis described in the affirmation. Using ELISA methodology in 88 patients undergoing laparoscopy, the researchers demonstrated significantly elevated levels of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) in serum and all four checkpoint molecules (sCTLA-4, sHLA-G, sPD-1, sPD-L1) in peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients compared to controls. However, critically, serum levels of sCTLA-4, sHLA-G, and sPD-1 showed no significant differences between endometriosis and control groups, suggesting compartmentalized rather than systemic elevation of exhaustion markers. The study's most significant finding was that serum sPD-L1 demonstrated excellent diagnostic potential with 77% sensitivity and 83% specificity at a 14.61 pg/mL cutoff, correlating positively with pelvic adhesion scores and myeloid cell counts. This evidence partially supports the pathophysiological analysis by confirming elevated checkpoint molecule activity in the local peritoneal environment where endometriotic lesions establish, but challenges the concept of generalized systemic T-cell exhaustion. The compartmentalized elevation of soluble checkpoint molecules suggests that immune dysfunction in endometriosis may be more localized than previously hypothesized, where peritoneal fluid concentrations create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that facilitates ectopic tissue survival while systemic immune checkpoint activity remains relatively normal, refining our understanding of how T-cell exhaustion contributes to the chronic inflammatory cascade described in the global thesis.

**Assessment:**

This multicenter retrospective study by Spagnolo et al. (2023) provides important but partially contradictory evidence regarding T-cell exhaustion markers in endometriosis. The study analyzed immune infiltrates in 43 ovarian endometriosis (OE) patients versus 54 endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) patients using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques. Notably, while the study confirmed elevated expression of T-cell exhaustion markers, it found that PD-1 and TIM3 were significantly MORE elevated in EAOC compared to OE rather than being primarily elevated in endometriosis itself. The authors demonstrated significant co-expression of PD-1+ and TIM3+ markers at the intraepithelial level in EAOC (p = 0.009), alongside correlations between exhaustion markers and CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages, supporting the immune dysfunction aspect of the pathophysiological analysis. However, this reference suggests that T-cell exhaustion may represent a progression marker from endometriosis toward malignant transformation rather than being fundamentally elevated in endometriosis alone. The study's limitation is that it lacks comparison with healthy controls, making it difficult to definitively establish whether PD-1 levels are elevated in endometriosis compared to normal tissue, though the findings do support the broader concept of immune dysregulation in the endometriosis-cancer continuum described in the global thesis.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive study by Suszczyk et al. (2022) provides nuanced evidence regarding immune checkpoint pathways in endometriosis, though it examines PD-L1/PD-L2 ligands rather than the PD-1/CTLA-4 receptors specified in the affirmation. Using flow cytometry and ELISA techniques in 72 endometriosis patients versus 20 controls, the study reveals complex compartmentalization of immune checkpoint molecules that both supports and refines the pathophysiological analysis. The researchers demonstrated significantly elevated PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on both myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in peritoneal fluid compared to peripheral blood (p < 0.001), supporting the concept of localized immunosuppression described in the global thesis. However, paradoxically, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on dendritic cells was significantly lower in peripheral blood of endometriosis patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05 respectively), while soluble PD-L1 was also reduced systemically in endometriosis patients (p < 0.001). This suggests a more complex immune dysregulation pattern than simple "elevation" of exhaustion markers, where immune checkpoint molecules are redistributed and concentrated in the peritoneal microenvironment while being depleted systemically. The findings align with the pathophysiological analysis by demonstrating that the peritoneal cavity becomes an immunosuppressive sanctuary that facilitates endometriotic implant survival through checkpoint pathway activation, though the systemic depletion may represent compensatory mechanisms or reflect the compartmentalized nature of immune dysfunction in endometriosis rather than generalized T-cell exhaustion.

**Assessment:**

This well-designed study by Olkowska-Truchanowicz et al. (2021) provides complementary evidence for immune dysfunction in endometriosis, though it examines regulatory T-cell (Treg) accumulation rather than the specific PD-1/CTLA-4 exhaustion markers addressed in the affirmation. Using flow cytometry and chemotaxis assays in 13 endometriosis patients versus 12 controls, the researchers demonstrated significantly increased proportions of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ Treg cells in peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients, accompanied by elevated concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β1/2, and CCL20. The study's most significant finding was establishing CCL20 as a key chemotactic factor responsible for Treg cell recruitment to the peritoneal cavity, with neutralizing anti-CCL20 antibodies significantly inhibiting peritoneal fluid chemotactic activity. While this evidence supports the broader concept of T-cell dysfunction described in the pathophysiological analysis, it represents a distinct but complementary mechanism to T-cell exhaustion—Treg accumulation creates immunosuppression through active regulatory pathways rather than through exhaustion-induced loss of effector functions. The strong positive correlations between Treg proportions and TGF-β/IL-10 concentrations align with the global thesis by demonstrating how chronic inflammatory environments can drive immune cell dysfunction that ultimately contributes to systemic inflammatory amplification and metabolic disruption, though through regulatory suppression rather than exhaustive depletion of immune responses.

## Reference 6

**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28575420

**Assessment:**

This well-designed study by Tanaka et al. (2017) provides important counterpoint evidence that challenges the direct elevation of exhaustion markers described in the affirmation, while paradoxically supporting the broader immune dysfunction thesis through a complementary mechanism. Using flow cytometry analysis of 27 endometriosis patients versus 28 controls, combined with mouse models using Foxp3DTR transgenic mice for Treg depletion, the researchers demonstrated that activated CD4+CD45RA-Foxp3hi regulatory T cells were significantly DECREASED rather than increased in endometrioma and endometrium compared to healthy controls. Crucially, when Treg cells were depleted in mouse models, endometriotic lesion number and weight increased significantly alongside elevated inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, demonstrating that Treg deficiency rather than exhaustion marker elevation drives endometriotic progression. While this appears to contradict the PD-1/CTLA-4 elevation described in the affirmation, it actually supports the global pathophysiological thesis through an alternative pathway—rather than T-cell exhaustion creating immune paralysis, regulatory T-cell deficiency creates uncontrolled inflammation that facilitates ectopic tissue establishment and systemic inflammatory amplification. This Treg dysfunction aligns with the global thesis by demonstrating how immune regulatory failure in endometriosis can contribute to the chronic inflammatory state that disrupts gastrointestinal function, promotes SIBO development, and ultimately leads to neuroendocrine dysfunction and metabolic suppression characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome, though through inadequate immunosuppression rather than excessive checkpoint inhibition.
