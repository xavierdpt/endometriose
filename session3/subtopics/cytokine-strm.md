# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** NF-κB pathway activation leads to cytokine storm in endometriosis-SIBO patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway serves as a central orchestrator of inflammatory responses in endometriosis-SIBO patients, creating a pathological amplification system that drives cytokine storm development. In endometriosis, ectopic endometrial implants release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pro-inflammatory mediators that activate NF-κB through multiple pathways, including TNF-α/TNFR1, IL-1β/IL-1R, and oxidative stress-mediated mechanisms. This activation leads to nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers (primarily p50/p65), which bind to κB sites in promoter regions of inflammatory genes, upregulating transcription of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The chronic nature of endometriotic inflammation creates sustained NF-κB activation, establishing a baseline inflammatory state that primes the immune system for exaggerated responses to additional stimuli.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth significantly amplifies this inflammatory cascade by introducing bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on intestinal epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. LPS binding to TLR4 triggers the MyD88-dependent pathway, leading to IRAK1/4 phosphorylation, TRAF6 ubiquitination, and subsequent activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. This results in IκBα phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation, allowing NF-κB nuclear translocation and massive upregulation of inflammatory gene expression. The combination of pre-existing endometriosis-driven NF-κB activation with SIBO-induced bacterial translocation creates a synergistic effect, where relatively small amounts of translocated bacterial products can trigger disproportionate inflammatory responses, leading to systemic cytokine storm characterized by elevated IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and interferon-γ levels.

This NF-κB-mediated cytokine storm directly supports the global thesis by creating the inflammatory milieu necessary for subsequent thyroidal and neuroendocrine disruption. Elevated IL-1β and TNF-α suppress hypothalamic TRH release through direct actions on hypothalamic neurons and by inducing sickness behavior pathways. IL-6 activates the JAK-STAT3 pathway in hepatocytes, leading to increased production of inflammatory proteins while simultaneously suppressing deiodinase enzymes (DIO1 and DIO2) responsible for peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. The cytokine storm also promotes glucocorticoid resistance by interfering with glucocorticoid receptor function, perpetuating HPA axis dysregulation. Additionally, systemic inflammation crosses the blood-brain barrier, activating microglia and triggering neuroinflammation that directly contributes to fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome, thus completing the pathophysiological cascade from endometriosis through SIBO to systemic metabolic and neurological dysfunction.
