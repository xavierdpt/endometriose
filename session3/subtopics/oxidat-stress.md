# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Oxidative stress increases while antioxidant capacity decreases in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Oxidative stress represents a fundamental mechanism through which endometriosis initiates and perpetuates the pathophysiological cascade leading to chronic fatigue syndrome. In endometriosis, ectopic endometrial tissue undergoes chronic inflammatory processes characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The inflammatory microenvironment within endometriotic lesions promotes excessive activation of NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction, leading to overproduction of superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. Simultaneously, the chronic inflammatory state depletes critical antioxidant systems including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione, vitamin E, and vitamin C, creating an imbalanced redox state that favors oxidative damage.

This oxidative stress directly contributes to gastrointestinal dysfunction through multiple mechanisms that support SIBO development. ROS-mediated damage to intestinal epithelial cells compromises tight junction integrity by oxidizing claudin and occludin proteins, leading to increased intestinal permeability. Oxidative stress also impairs enteric nervous system function by damaging neurons that control gut motility, resulting in intestinal stasis that favors bacterial overgrowth. Furthermore, oxidative damage to the gut mucosa disrupts the normal antimicrobial barrier function and alters the local immune environment, creating conditions conducive to pathogenic bacterial colonization in the small intestine.

The systemic consequences of oxidative stress amplify the endometriosis-SIBO-fatigue pathway through direct effects on thyroidal and neuroendocrine function. Oxidative damage to hepatic deiodinase enzymes, particularly DIO1, impairs peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3, contributing to functional hypothyroidism. ROS also directly damage mitochondrial respiratory complexes throughout the body, leading to cellular energy crisis and reduced ATP production that manifests as fatigue. Additionally, oxidative stress promotes neuroinflammation by activating microglia and damaging the blood-brain barrier, while simultaneously depleting neurotransmitter synthesis cofactors. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle where oxidative damage promotes further inflammation, which generates more ROS, ultimately maintaining the pathological state that underlies chronic fatigue syndrome in endometriosis patients.
