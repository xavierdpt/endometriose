# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Bile acid sequestration mechanisms help restore normal gut-liver axis function

# Pathophysiological Analysis

In the context of endometriosis-associated SIBO and systemic inflammation, bile acid sequestration represents a critical therapeutic mechanism for breaking the pathological gut-liver axis dysfunction that perpetuates chronic fatigue syndrome. Under normal physiological conditions, bile acids undergo enterohepatic circulation, with approximately 95% being reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and returned to the liver via the portal circulation. However, in endometriosis-associated SIBO, bacterial overgrowth leads to premature deconjugation of bile salts by bacterial bile salt hydrolases, particularly from gram-positive anaerobes such as Lactobacillus and Clostridium species. This deconjugation disrupts the normal enterohepatic circulation, resulting in malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, altered gut microbiome composition, and increased colonic bile acid exposure, which can trigger inflammatory cascades through activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathways and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling.

The therapeutic intervention of bile acid sequestration using agents such as cholestyramine or colesevelam functions by binding deconjugated bile acids in the small intestine, preventing their reabsorption and facilitating their excretion in feces. This mechanism serves multiple pathophysiological functions within the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue cascade: first, it reduces the pool of deconjugated bile acids available for bacterial metabolism, thereby decreasing the production of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, which are potent inflammatory mediators that can activate pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. Second, bile acid sequestration forces the liver to synthesize new bile acids from cholesterol via the rate-limiting enzyme 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which not only helps restore normal bile acid composition but also activates farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling pathways that regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, potentially countering the metabolic dysfunction associated with thyroid hormone resistance.

Furthermore, bile acid sequestration helps restore gut barrier integrity by reducing the inflammatory burden on intestinal epithelial cells and promoting the restoration of tight junction proteins such as claudin-1 and occludin, which are frequently compromised in endometriosis-associated gut dysfunction. By normalizing bile acid metabolism, sequestration therapy indirectly supports the restoration of normal gut microbiome composition, reducing bacterial endotoxin (LPS) production and subsequent systemic endotoxemia that drives hepatic Kupffer cell activation and perpetuates the inflammatory cascade affecting thyroid hormone metabolism. This restoration of gut-liver axis homeostasis is crucial for breaking the pathological cycle, as it reduces the systemic inflammatory burden that suppresses hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function through cytokine-mediated inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 via type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) suppression, ultimately supporting the resolution of metabolic suppression and chronic fatigue symptoms.
