# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Stress-induced mechanisms exacerbate endometriosis symptoms

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Stress-induced mechanisms create a multifaceted exacerbation of endometriosis through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which fundamentally alters the inflammatory milieu and hormonal environment. Chronic stress leads to sustained elevation of cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which paradoxically can create a cortisol-resistant inflammatory state where immune cells become less responsive to cortisol's anti-inflammatory signals. This resistance amplifies the existing inflammatory cascade in endometriosis, characterized by elevated IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, while simultaneously promoting estrogen synthesis through stress-induced activation of aromatase (CYP19A1) in ectopic endometrial tissue. The resulting estrogen-mediated cytokine amplification creates a self-perpetuating cycle where stress hormones directly enhance the inflammatory and proliferative characteristics of endometriotic lesions.

The stress-endometriosis interaction significantly compromises gastrointestinal integrity through multiple pathways that predispose to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) development. Chronic stress reduces gastric acid production, impairs intestinal motility through disruption of the enteric nervous system, and compromises the gut barrier function by downregulating tight junction proteins such as claudin and occludin. These effects are mediated through stress-induced elevation of mast cell degranulation and histamine release, which increase intestinal permeability and create an environment conducive to bacterial translocation. Furthermore, stress-related cortisol dysregulation suppresses secretory IgA production and alters the gut microbiome composition, reducing beneficial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria that normally maintain intestinal barrier integrity and regulate local immune responses.

The integration of stress-induced mechanisms into the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway occurs through amplification of systemic endotoxemia and subsequent disruption of thyroidal function. Stress-mediated gut barrier dysfunction enhances lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin translocation from gram-negative bacteria, activating the TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB pathway in hepatic Kupffer cells and creating systemic endotoxemia. This bacterial endotoxin burden, amplified by stress-induced immune dysfunction, suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis through inhibition of TRH release and TSH receptor desensitization. Concurrently, stress-elevated cortisol directly inhibits peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism by suppressing DIO1 type-1 deiodinase activity, reducing free T3 levels and creating a state of functional hypothyroidism. This stress-amplified metabolic suppression accelerates the progression toward chronic fatigue syndrome by impairing mitochondrial ATP production, reducing thermogenesis, and promoting neuroinflammation through microglial activation in response to circulating inflammatory mediators.
