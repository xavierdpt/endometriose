# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Thermogenesis and energy expenditure are decreased in endometriosis patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The decreased thermogenesis and energy expenditure observed in endometriosis patients represents a critical downstream consequence of the systemic inflammatory cascade and thyroidal dysfunction described in the global research context. This metabolic suppression primarily occurs through the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, where chronic inflammatory cytokines (particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) suppress thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and release from the hypothalamus. Simultaneously, the inflammatory milieu inhibits type-1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in peripheral tissues, particularly the liver, which is essential for converting the prohormone T4 to the metabolically active T3. This results in decreased circulating free T3 levels, the primary regulator of basal metabolic rate and thermogenesis, leading to a state of functional hypothyroidism despite potentially normal TSH and T4 levels.

At the cellular level, the reduced thermogenic capacity is mediated through impaired mitochondrial respiratory function and ATP synthesis efficiency. The chronic inflammatory state associated with endometriosis and potential SIBO promotes oxidative stress and ceramide accumulation, which directly interfere with mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III. Furthermore, the decreased T3 availability reduces the transcription of key thermogenic genes including uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) in brown adipose tissue and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis. The concurrent elevation of cortisol due to HPA axis activation further suppresses cellular metabolism by inhibiting glucose uptake and promoting gluconeogenesis, creating a catabolic state that prioritizes inflammatory response over energy-intensive thermogenic processes.

This metabolic suppression creates a self-reinforcing pathological cycle that directly supports the global thesis linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. The reduced energy expenditure and impaired thermogenesis not only manifest as persistent fatigue and cold intolerance but also compromise immune function and tissue repair mechanisms, perpetuating the inflammatory state. The decreased metabolic rate reduces the clearance of inflammatory mediators and bacterial endotoxins, maintaining the chronic inflammatory burden that continues to suppress thyroidal function and cellular energy production. This metabolic-immune-inflammatory triangle establishes a pathological steady state where decreased thermogenesis both results from and contributes to the systemic dysregulation characteristic of the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue syndrome complex.
