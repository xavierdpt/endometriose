# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Fatty acid oxidation is impaired contributing to metabolic dysfunction

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Fatty acid oxidation impairment represents a critical downstream consequence of the endometriosis-SIBO inflammatory cascade that significantly contributes to metabolic dysfunction and chronic fatigue syndrome. The chronic inflammatory state induced by endometriotic lesions and amplified by SIBO-derived endotoxemia creates a metabolic environment hostile to efficient fatty acid β-oxidation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, directly inhibit key enzymes in the fatty acid oxidation pathway, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid entry into mitochondria. Additionally, the persistent inflammatory milieu promotes insulin resistance and dysregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), a master transcriptional regulator of fatty acid oxidation genes, leading to decreased expression of enzymes critical for β-oxidation including acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.

The thyroidal dysfunction resulting from HPA axis suppression and peripheral conversion impairment further exacerbates fatty acid oxidation defects through multiple mechanisms. Reduced free T3 levels directly impair mitochondrial biogenesis and decrease the expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes, as thyroid hormones are essential co-activators of PPAR-α-mediated transcription. Concurrent cortisol dysregulation, characterized by both elevated chronic levels and impaired acute response capacity, promotes a shift toward glucose utilization while suppressing lipolysis and fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue. This creates a metabolic inflexibility where cells become increasingly dependent on glucose metabolism while losing the ability to efficiently utilize fatty acids, particularly problematic during fasting states or periods of increased energy demand.

The impaired fatty acid oxidation creates a pathological feedback loop that perpetuates the chronic fatigue phenotype through multiple interconnected mechanisms. Reduced β-oxidation capacity leads to acetyl-CoA depletion, limiting ATP production via the citric acid cycle and forcing increased reliance on less efficient glycolytic pathways. This metabolic shift results in decreased overall energy production, increased lactate accumulation, and altered cellular redox status. Furthermore, impaired fatty acid oxidation disrupts the production of ketone bodies, which serve as alternative fuel sources for the brain and peripheral tissues during metabolic stress. The resulting cellular energy deficit manifests as profound fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and impaired cognitive function. Additionally, accumulated fatty acid intermediates can promote further inflammatory signaling through toll-like receptor activation, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and energy depletion that characterizes the chronic fatigue syndrome phenotype in endometriosis patients.
