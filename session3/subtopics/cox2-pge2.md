# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** COX-2 upregulation in endometriosis leads to increased PGE2 synthesis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

COX-2 upregulation in endometriotic lesions represents a critical inflammatory amplification mechanism that directly supports the proposed endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway. In ectopic endometrial tissue, elevated COX-2 expression drives the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), which is subsequently converted to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by prostaglandin E synthase. This increased PGE2 synthesis creates a localized pro-inflammatory microenvironment that not only perpetuates the survival and proliferation of endometriotic implants but also contributes to the systemic inflammatory burden that characterizes this condition. The elevated PGE2 levels promote vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and enhanced recruitment of immune cells, particularly macrophages and neutrophils, thereby establishing self-reinforcing inflammatory cycles within the peritoneal cavity.

The systemic effects of chronically elevated PGE2 extend beyond local pelvic inflammation to significantly impact gastrointestinal function, a key component of the proposed pathophysiological cascade. PGE2 acts on EP receptors throughout the gastrointestinal tract, where it can reduce gastric acid secretion, alter intestinal motility patterns, and compromise the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. These effects create conditions conducive to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) by reducing the antimicrobial effects of gastric acid and disrupting the normal migrating motor complex that serves as the intestinal "housekeeping" mechanism. Furthermore, PGE2-mediated increases in intestinal permeability can facilitate bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption, thereby amplifying the systemic inflammatory response and creating the endotoxemia that characterizes the next phase of the proposed pathway.

The inflammatory cascade initiated by COX-2-derived PGE2 also directly impacts neuroendocrine function through its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axes. PGE2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and act centrally to stimulate corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from the hypothalamus, leading to chronic HPA axis activation and eventual glucocorticoid resistance. Simultaneously, chronic PGE2 exposure can suppress thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and release, contributing to the central hypothyroidism that characterizes the metabolic suppression seen in chronic fatigue syndrome. Additionally, PGE2 can directly inhibit type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in peripheral tissues, impairing the conversion of T4 to the active hormone T3 and further compromising metabolic function. This multi-level disruption of neuroendocrine function creates the hormonal milieu necessary for the development of chronic fatigue symptoms, establishing COX-2/PGE2 upregulation as a crucial early step in the proposed pathophysiological cascade.
