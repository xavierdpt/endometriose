# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Mitochondrial function is impaired in endometriosis contributing to reduced ATP synthesis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical mechanistic link in the endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway, serving as both a consequence of chronic inflammation and a perpetuating factor in the pathological cascade. In endometriosis, ectopic endometrial implants create a state of persistent oxidative stress through enhanced inflammatory cytokine production (particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) and elevated prostaglandin E2 synthesis via COX-2 upregulation. This chronic inflammatory milieu directly impairs mitochondrial respiratory chain function through cytokine-mediated inhibition of complex I and complex IV activities, while simultaneously promoting mitochondrial DNA damage and reducing the expression of key mitochondrial biogenesis factors such as PGC-1α. The resulting decrease in ATP synthesis capacity creates an energy deficit that compromises cellular functions essential for maintaining gastrointestinal barrier integrity, thus facilitating the development of increased intestinal permeability and subsequent SIBO formation.

The reduction in mitochondrial ATP production creates a metabolically compromised state that amplifies the systemic consequences of SIBO-mediated endotoxemia. When bacterial lipopolysaccharides breach the compromised gut barrier and enter systemic circulation, energy-depleted immune cells exhibit altered responses characterized by both hyperactivation of pro-inflammatory pathways (due to enhanced NF-κB signaling under low ATP conditions) and impaired resolution of inflammation (due to insufficient energy for proper macrophage polarization and regulatory T-cell function). This bioenergetic dysfunction particularly affects hepatic Kupffer cells and peripheral immune cells, leading to sustained cytokine production that further suppresses mitochondrial function through a feed-forward inflammatory loop. Additionally, ATP depletion in hypothalamic neurons disrupts normal neuroendocrine signaling, contributing to the suppression of TRH release and subsequent downstream effects on thyroid hormone metabolism.

The mitochondrial energy crisis ultimately manifests as the metabolic suppression characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome through multiple convergent pathways. Reduced ATP availability impairs the energy-dependent processes required for efficient thyroid hormone activation, including the function of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) enzymes responsible for peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion. This bioenergetic constraint, combined with cytokine-mediated DIO1 inhibition, creates a state of functional thyroid hormone resistance despite potentially normal circulating hormone levels. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue directly contributes to exercise intolerance and fatigue symptoms, while energy depletion in neuronal tissues promotes neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. The self-perpetuating nature of this mitochondrial-inflammatory cycle helps explain the chronicity and treatment resistance often observed in the endometriosis-chronic fatigue syndrome complex, highlighting the necessity for therapeutic approaches that simultaneously address inflammatory burden and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

# Literature Review

## Reference 1

**URL:** https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8788578

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Kobayashi et al. provides strong empirical support for the affirmation that mitochondrial function is impaired in endometriosis, contributing to reduced ATP synthesis. The authors present compelling evidence for metabolic reprogramming in endometriotic cells, characterized by a shift from efficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to less efficient aerobic glycolysis—a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. The study demonstrates that endometriotic tissues exhibit significantly reduced mitochondrial respiration and energy production compared to normal endometrial tissue, with peritoneal mesothelial cells adjacent to endometriotic lesions showing higher glycolysis, increased lactate production, and lower mitochondrial respiration. This metabolic conversion is orchestrated by the TGF-β1–HIF-1α–PDK1–PDH–LDHA pathway, where hypoxia-induced PDK1 expression decreases PDH activity, suppressing pyruvate-to-acetyl-CoA conversion and consequently reducing mitochondrial energy production. The authors identify four key metabolic hallmarks: enhanced glucose uptake through GLUT overexpression, increased glycolytic enzyme activation, lactate accumulation, and the critical metabolic switch away from OXPHOS. While this metabolic adaptation serves as a survival mechanism to reduce ROS-mediated cell death in the inflammatory microenvironment, it directly supports the pathophysiological analysis by confirming that chronic inflammation in endometriosis creates an energy-deficit state through mitochondrial suppression, which could contribute to systemic fatigue and the downstream effects on immune function, gut barrier integrity, and neuroendocrine regulation described in the broader endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway.

## Reference 2

**URL:** https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/bmc-2019-0017/html

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Anderson and Reiter presents a more complex and potentially contradictory perspective on mitochondrial function in endometriosis compared to the pathophysiological analysis above. The authors propose that endometriosis involves "heightened levels of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production" in mitochondria, driven by estrogen receptor-beta (ERβ)-mediated increases in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD)2 as a compensatory response to elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress. This apparent increase in ATP synthesis capacity contradicts the core affirmation of mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP production, suggesting instead a hyperactivated mitochondrial state. However, the authors' framework may still support the broader pathophysiological thesis through their emphasis on systemic consequences: they detail how chronic inflammation, gut dysbiosis, decreased butyrate production, and disrupted melatonergic pathways create a complex pathological network that could ultimately overwhelm even compensated mitochondrial function. The paper's discussion of IDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism away from melatonin synthesis, combined with pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression of pineal melatonin production, aligns with the neuroinflammatory and metabolic suppression aspects of the chronic fatigue pathway. While this reference challenges the direct mitochondrial energy deficit model, it provides valuable insight into the multisystem regulatory dysfunction that could explain how initially compensated mitochondrial hyperactivity might eventually progress to the exhausted, ATP-depleted state characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Clower et al. provides substantial mechanistic support for the affirmation that mitochondrial function is impaired in endometriosis, while introducing the novel concept of ferroptosis as an additional pathway linking mitochondrial dysfunction to cellular energy depletion. The authors present compelling evidence for elevated oxidative stress markers in endometriosis patients, including increased reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation products (particularly malondialdehyde and oxidized LDL), and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities—all of which directly compromise mitochondrial respiratory chain function and ATP synthesis capacity. Particularly relevant is their detailed discussion of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death that occurs when glutathione-dependent antioxidant systems fail due to excessive ROS accumulation, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane rupture and cellular energy crisis. The paper demonstrates that endometriotic tissues exhibit dysregulated iron homeostasis with elevated ferritin levels and enhanced transferrin saturation, creating conditions conducive to Fenton chemistry-mediated free radical production that directly damages mitochondrial components. The authors' evidence for NF-κB pathway activation by oxidative stress, resulting in enhanced cytokine production (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) and COX-2 upregulation, directly supports the pathophysiological analysis by confirming the feed-forward inflammatory loop that perpetuates mitochondrial suppression. While the paper does not explicitly address the downstream consequences on gut barrier integrity or neuroendocrine function, it provides robust foundational evidence for the oxidative stress-mitochondrial dysfunction axis that serves as the mechanistic basis for the broader endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway, particularly through its documentation of how chronic inflammation creates the bioenergetic deficit that could compromise energy-dependent cellular processes essential for maintaining systemic homeostasis.

## Reference 4

**URL:** https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8788578

**Assessment:**

This reference represents a duplicate of Reference 1, but its comprehensive review by Kobayashi et al. merits additional emphasis for its detailed mechanistic analysis of the metabolic reprogramming in endometriosis that directly supports the affirmation of mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP synthesis. The paper provides extensive evidence for four distinct metabolic hallmarks that collectively demonstrate impaired mitochondrial function: enhanced glucose uptake through GLUT overexpression, increased glycolytic enzyme activation (particularly PDK1 and LDHA), lactate accumulation, and the critical metabolic conversion from efficient mitochondrial OXPHOS to less efficient aerobic glycolysis. Particularly compelling is the authors' documentation that endometriotic tissues exhibit "reduced mitochondrial respiration and energy production compared to normal endometrial tissue," with peritoneal mesothelial cells adjacent to endometriotic lesions showing "significantly higher glycolysis, increased lactate production, and lower mitochondrial respiration" compared to controls. The paper's detailed explanation of the TGF-β1–HIF-1α–PDK1–PDH–LDHA pathway provides the mechanistic foundation for understanding how chronic inflammation suppresses mitochondrial ATP production: hypoxia-induced PDK1 expression decreases PDH activity, suppressing pyruvate-to-acetyl-CoA conversion and consequently reducing mitochondrial energy production by up to 95% (from 38 ATP per glucose molecule via OXPHOS to only 2 ATP per glucose molecule via glycolysis). While the authors frame this metabolic adaptation as a survival strategy to reduce ROS-mediated cell death rather than pathological dysfunction, their evidence strongly supports the broader pathophysiological analysis by confirming that endometriosis creates a bioenergetic deficit that could compromise energy-dependent processes essential for immune function, gut barrier integrity, and neuroendocrine regulation in the endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway.

## Reference 5

**URL:** https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.11.5.9141507

**Assessment:**

This foundational 1997 study by Brand and Hermfisse presents evidence that challenges the core affirmation by demonstrating that the metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis may represent an adaptive protective strategy rather than pathological dysfunction. The authors provide compelling experimental data showing that proliferating thymocytes deliberately switch from primarily oxidative ATP production (88% in resting cells) to predominantly glycolytic ATP synthesis (86% in proliferating cells), with this metabolic reprogramming coinciding with a near-complete abolition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared to resting cells. Their demonstration that mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors strongly reduce ROS formation in resting thymocytes, combined with evidence that pyruvate functions as an H₂O₂ scavenger, supports their thesis that aerobic glycolysis serves as a protective mechanism to minimize oxidative stress during periods of enhanced biosynthesis and cell division. While this perspective initially appears to contradict the pathophysiological analysis suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to energy deficits, it actually provides crucial mechanistic insight into why endometriotic tissues adopt similar metabolic patterns: the chronic inflammatory environment rich in cytokines and oxidative stress may drive cells toward glycolytic metabolism as a survival mechanism, but this "protective" adaptation comes at the cost of dramatically reduced ATP efficiency (from 38 ATP per glucose via OXPHOS to only 2 ATP per glucose via glycolysis), ultimately creating the energy deficit state that contributes to systemic fatigue and compromises energy-dependent processes essential for immune function, gut barrier integrity, and neuroendocrine regulation in the broader endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue syndrome pathway.

## Reference 6

**URL:** https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/metabolites/metabolites-12-01160/article_deploy/metabolites-12-01160.pdf

**Assessment:**

This provocative viewpoint by Seledtsov and von Delwig presents a paradigm-shifting perspective that both challenges and potentially reconciles the mitochondrial dysfunction affirmation by reframing the metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis as an adaptive survival mechanism rather than purely pathological dysfunction. The authors propose that cellular senescence results from "disbalanced ATP/ROS mitochondrial production manifesting itself in reduced ATP and a concomitant increase in ROS production," which directly supports the core affirmation while providing a novel therapeutic framework. Critically, their evidence demonstrates that glycolytic ATP production is "not associated with the generation of cytodestructive ROS," suggesting that the metabolic reprogramming observed in endometriotic tissues may represent an evolutionarily conserved protective response to chronic inflammation rather than simple energy failure. Their proposal for therapeutic interventions targeting glycolysis enhancement through intermittent hypoxia and pharmacological mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors (metformin, resveratrol, progesterone) offers a counterintuitive but mechanistically sound approach that could address the energy deficit while simultaneously reducing oxidative stress burden. While this perspective appears to contradict the traditional view of mitochondrial dysfunction as purely detrimental, it actually provides crucial insight into why endometriotic tissues adopt seemingly inefficient metabolic patterns: the 95% reduction in ATP efficiency (from 36 ATP per glucose via OXPHOS to 2 ATP via glycolysis) may be an acceptable trade-off to minimize ROS-mediated tissue damage in the chronic inflammatory environment, but this "protective" adaptation still creates the systemic energy deficit that compromises immune function, gut barrier integrity, and neuroendocrine regulation in the broader endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue syndrome pathway, thus supporting the therapeutic rationale for addressing both inflammatory burden and bioenergetic optimization simultaneously.
