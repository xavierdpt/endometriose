# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Mitochondrial function is impaired in endometriosis contributing to reduced ATP synthesis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical mechanistic link in the endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway, serving as both a consequence of chronic inflammation and a perpetuating factor in the pathological cascade. In endometriosis, ectopic endometrial implants create a state of persistent oxidative stress through enhanced inflammatory cytokine production (particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) and elevated prostaglandin E2 synthesis via COX-2 upregulation. This chronic inflammatory milieu directly impairs mitochondrial respiratory chain function through cytokine-mediated inhibition of complex I and complex IV activities, while simultaneously promoting mitochondrial DNA damage and reducing the expression of key mitochondrial biogenesis factors such as PGC-1α. The resulting decrease in ATP synthesis capacity creates an energy deficit that compromises cellular functions essential for maintaining gastrointestinal barrier integrity, thus facilitating the development of increased intestinal permeability and subsequent SIBO formation.

The reduction in mitochondrial ATP production creates a metabolically compromised state that amplifies the systemic consequences of SIBO-mediated endotoxemia. When bacterial lipopolysaccharides breach the compromised gut barrier and enter systemic circulation, energy-depleted immune cells exhibit altered responses characterized by both hyperactivation of pro-inflammatory pathways (due to enhanced NF-κB signaling under low ATP conditions) and impaired resolution of inflammation (due to insufficient energy for proper macrophage polarization and regulatory T-cell function). This bioenergetic dysfunction particularly affects hepatic Kupffer cells and peripheral immune cells, leading to sustained cytokine production that further suppresses mitochondrial function through a feed-forward inflammatory loop. Additionally, ATP depletion in hypothalamic neurons disrupts normal neuroendocrine signaling, contributing to the suppression of TRH release and subsequent downstream effects on thyroid hormone metabolism.

The mitochondrial energy crisis ultimately manifests as the metabolic suppression characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome through multiple convergent pathways. Reduced ATP availability impairs the energy-dependent processes required for efficient thyroid hormone activation, including the function of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) enzymes responsible for peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion. This bioenergetic constraint, combined with cytokine-mediated DIO1 inhibition, creates a state of functional thyroid hormone resistance despite potentially normal circulating hormone levels. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue directly contributes to exercise intolerance and fatigue symptoms, while energy depletion in neuronal tissues promotes neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. The self-perpetuating nature of this mitochondrial-inflammatory cycle helps explain the chronicity and treatment resistance often observed in the endometriosis-chronic fatigue syndrome complex, highlighting the necessity for therapeutic approaches that simultaneously address inflammatory burden and mitochondrial bioenergetics.
