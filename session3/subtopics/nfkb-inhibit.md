# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** NF-κB pathway inhibition reduces systemic inflammation in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) serves as a central transcriptional regulator orchestrating inflammatory responses in endometriosis, making its inhibition a critical therapeutic target for reducing systemic inflammation. In endometriotic lesions, NF-κB activation is triggered by multiple stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β), bacterial endotoxins from compromised gut barrier function, and oxidative stress from ectopic endometrial tissue. Once activated, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and upregulates transcription of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), creating a self-perpetuating inflammatory cascade that extends beyond the pelvic cavity to affect systemic immune homeostasis.

The systemic inflammatory burden generated through NF-κB-mediated pathways directly contributes to the gastrointestinal dysfunction proposed in the global thesis. NF-κB activation promotes intestinal epithelial barrier disruption through downregulation of tight junction proteins (claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1) and upregulation of myosin light chain kinase, facilitating bacterial translocation and endotoxemia. This compromised gut barrier allows lipopolysaccharide and other bacterial products to enter systemic circulation, further activating NF-κB in distant tissues including hepatic Kupffer cells and creating the conditions necessary for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) development.

The downstream consequences of sustained NF-κB activation align directly with the proposed endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway through multiple mechanisms. NF-κB-driven cytokine production, particularly IL-6 and TNF-α, suppresses hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function by inhibiting thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and reducing TSH sensitivity at the thyroid level. Additionally, NF-κB activation in peripheral tissues impairs type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity, reducing the conversion of T4 to active T3 and contributing to the metabolic suppression characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. The inflammatory mediators produced through NF-κB signaling also cross the blood-brain barrier, activating microglia and promoting neuroinflammation that manifests as cognitive dysfunction and fatigue, thus completing the pathophysiological link from endometriotic inflammation to systemic metabolic and neurological dysfunction.
