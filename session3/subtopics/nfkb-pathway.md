# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** NF-κB pathway activation is central to endometriosis-associated inflammation

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway serves as a master regulator of inflammatory responses and represents a central mechanistic hub in the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. In endometriotic lesions, persistent tissue injury, immune cell infiltration, and exposure to inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and lipopolysaccharides from potential SIBO-associated bacterial translocation continuously activate NF-κB signaling. This activation occurs through the canonical pathway involving IκB kinase (IKK) complex phosphorylation of inhibitory IκBα proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby releasing NF-κB dimers (primarily p65/p50) to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of pro-inflammatory genes including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and multiple cytokine genes.

The sustained NF-κB activation in endometriosis creates a self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle that extends beyond local pelvic tissues to affect systemic physiology. NF-κB-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, not only amplifies local inflammation but also contributes to increased intestinal permeability through disruption of tight junction proteins such as claudin-1 and occludin. This enhanced gut barrier dysfunction facilitates bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption, creating additional NF-κB stimulation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Furthermore, NF-κB signaling promotes the expression of adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and angiogenic factors that facilitate endometriotic implant survival and growth, while simultaneously suppressing apoptotic pathways that would normally eliminate ectopic endometrial tissue.

The systemic consequences of chronic NF-κB activation directly support the proposed mechanism linking endometriosis to thyroidal dysfunction and metabolic suppression. NF-κB-induced cytokines, particularly IL-1β and TNF-α, interfere with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function by suppressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis, reducing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) sensitivity, and inhibiting peripheral thyroid hormone conversion through suppression of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity. Additionally, NF-κB activation in hepatocytes and peripheral tissues promotes inflammatory insulin resistance, impairs mitochondrial biogenesis, and disrupts cellular energy metabolism through inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). These metabolic disruptions, combined with NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation affecting hypothalamic energy sensing and neurotransmitter synthesis, create the biochemical foundation for the chronic fatigue phenotype observed in this proposed pathophysiological cascade.
