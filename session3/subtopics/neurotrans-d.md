# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Neurotransmitter dysfunction leads to mood disorders in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Neurotransmitter dysfunction in endometriosis represents a critical mechanistic bridge linking chronic pelvic inflammation to mood disorders and the broader cascade culminating in chronic fatigue syndrome. The persistent inflammatory milieu characteristic of endometriosis, driven by elevated cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, directly disrupts neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism through multiple pathways. Chronic inflammation reduces tryptophan availability for serotonin synthesis via increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, which shunts tryptophan toward the kynurenine pathway, producing neurotoxic metabolites like quinolinic acid. Simultaneously, inflammatory cytokines impair the blood-brain barrier integrity, allowing peripheral inflammatory mediators to directly influence central nervous system neurotransmitter function and contribute to neuroinflammation-mediated mood dysregulation.

The disruption of key neurotransmitter systems creates a neurochemical environment conducive to mood disorders that amplifies the overall pathophysiological burden. Serotonin deficiency, compounded by inflammatory interference with its reuptake mechanisms, contributes to depression and anxiety commonly observed in endometriosis patients. Additionally, chronic inflammation disrupts dopaminergic pathways in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system, impairing reward processing and motivation—symptoms that overlap significantly with chronic fatigue syndrome presentations. The inflammatory cascade also interferes with GABAergic neurotransmission, reducing the brain's capacity for stress resilience and contributing to anxiety disorders. These neurotransmitter imbalances create a state of chronic psychological stress that further activates the HPA axis, perpetuating cortisol dysregulation and contributing to the downstream thyroidal and metabolic consequences outlined in the global thesis.

The mood disorders resulting from neurotransmitter dysfunction serve as both consequence and contributor to the pathological cycle described in the global research framework. Depression and anxiety associated with altered serotonin and dopamine signaling can exacerbate gut dysfunction through the gut-brain axis, potentially worsening SIBO development and intestinal permeability. The chronic stress response triggered by mood disorders maintains elevated cortisol levels, which suppress thyroidal function through multiple mechanisms including reduced TSH sensitivity and impaired peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion. Furthermore, neurotransmitter dysfunction-mediated sleep disturbances and altered circadian rhythms disrupt metabolic homeostasis and immune function, creating additional pathways through which mood disorders contribute to the ultimate manifestation of chronic fatigue syndrome. This neurochemical component thus represents an essential mechanistic link that helps explain the high comorbidity between endometriosis, mood disorders, and chronic fatigue states.
