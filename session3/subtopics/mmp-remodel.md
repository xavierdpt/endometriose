# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Matrix metalloproteinases play a key role in tissue remodeling in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) represent critical enzymes in the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to systemic inflammatory dysfunction and subsequent chronic fatigue syndrome. In endometriosis, elevated MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-3 activity facilitates the degradation of extracellular matrix components, enabling ectopic endometrial tissue to invade and establish at extrauterine sites. This aberrant tissue remodeling process creates a state of chronic wound healing characterized by persistent activation of inflammatory cascades, including increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. The dysregulated MMP activity not only perpetuates local tissue damage and repair cycles but also contributes to the release of inflammatory mediators into systemic circulation, establishing the foundation for widespread immune activation.

The excessive MMP-mediated tissue remodeling in endometriosis directly contributes to gastrointestinal complications through multiple mechanisms. When endometrial implants involve bowel structures, MMP activity can compromise intestinal barrier integrity by degrading tight junction proteins and basement membrane components. This process increases intestinal permeability, creating conditions favorable for bacterial translocation and the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Furthermore, MMP-induced tissue remodeling can alter normal gastrointestinal motility patterns through the formation of adhesions and fibrotic changes, creating intestinal stasis that further promotes bacterial overgrowth. The resulting endotoxemia from increased gut permeability amplifies systemic inflammation through TLR4-mediated pathways, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of inflammatory activation.

The systemic inflammatory state perpetuated by dysregulated MMP activity ultimately disrupts neuroendocrine function through multiple interconnected pathways. Chronic elevation of inflammatory cytokines, facilitated by ongoing MMP-mediated tissue damage, suppresses hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function by inhibiting TRH and TSH release while simultaneously impairing peripheral thyroid hormone conversion through cytokine-mediated inhibition of type-1 deiodinase (DIO1). Additionally, persistent inflammation activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to chronic cortisol elevation that further suppresses thyroid function and promotes glucocorticoid resistance. This neuroendocrine disruption results in metabolic rate suppression, neuroinflammation, and the characteristic fatigue and cognitive dysfunction observed in chronic fatigue syndrome, demonstrating how MMP-mediated tissue remodeling in endometriosis can initiate a complex pathophysiological cascade culminating in systemic metabolic and neurological dysfunction.
