# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** NK cell cytotoxicity is reduced in endometriosis patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Natural killer (NK) cells serve as critical first-line defenders in innate immunity, responsible for eliminating aberrant cells through cytotoxic mechanisms involving perforin and granzyme release. In endometriosis, reduced NK cell cytotoxicity creates a permissive environment for the establishment and persistence of ectopic endometrial tissue. This immunological dysfunction occurs through multiple interconnected pathways: chronic exposure to inflammatory cytokines (particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) leads to NK cell exhaustion and functional impairment, while altered estrogen signaling in the inflammatory microenvironment further suppresses NK cell activation pathways. The compromised cytotoxic capacity allows ectopic endometrial implants to evade immune surveillance, promoting their survival, angiogenesis through VEGF upregulation, and continued inflammatory cytokine production.

The reduced NK cell cytotoxicity directly amplifies the systemic inflammatory cascade central to the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway. Dysfunctional NK cells fail to adequately clear inflammatory mediators and cellular debris, contributing to sustained activation of NF-κB signaling pathways and perpetuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine networks. This chronic inflammatory state creates a feedback loop where persistent IL-1β and TNF-α not only maintain NK cell dysfunction but also disrupt gastrointestinal barrier integrity through zonulin upregulation and tight junction protein degradation. The compromised intestinal permeability facilitates bacterial translocation and endotoxemia, establishing the foundation for SIBO development and further immune dysregulation that characterizes this pathophysiological cascade.

Furthermore, the systemic immune dysfunction associated with impaired NK cell cytotoxicity contributes to the downstream disruption of neuroendocrine axes essential for metabolic homeostasis. Chronic cytokine exposure from inadequate NK cell-mediated immune regulation leads to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone production. The persistent inflammatory milieu also inhibits peripheral deiodinase activity (DIO1/DIO2), impairing T4 to T3 conversion and creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite normal TSH levels. This metabolic suppression, combined with neuroinflammatory processes affecting neurotransmitter synthesis and mitochondrial function, ultimately manifests as the chronic fatigue syndrome phenotype, demonstrating how reduced NK cell cytotoxicity serves as a critical early pathophysiological mechanism in this complex multi-system disorder.
