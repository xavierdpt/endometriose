# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

**Affirmation under study:** Central nervous system inflammation occurs in endometriosis patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Central nervous system inflammation represents a critical mechanistic link in the proposed endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway, serving as both a consequence of systemic inflammatory processes and a perpetuating factor in the pathological cycle. In endometriosis patients, chronic peripheral inflammation driven by ectopic endometrial tissue and potential SIBO-mediated endotoxemia can breach the blood-brain barrier through multiple mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, elevated in endometriosis patients, can directly compromise blood-brain barrier integrity by downregulating tight junction proteins like claudin-5 and occludin. Additionally, these cytokines can activate the vagal pathway and circumventricular organs, providing alternative routes for inflammatory signals to reach the central nervous system without requiring direct barrier penetration.

Once inflammatory mediators access the CNS, they trigger microglial activation through toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, particularly TLR4-MyD88 cascades responding to bacterial lipopolysaccharides from compromised gut barrier function. Activated microglia subsequently produce a secondary wave of neuroinflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin E2, creating a localized inflammatory environment within the brain. This neuroinflammation particularly affects regions critical for energy regulation and stress response, including the hypothalamus, where inflammatory cytokines can directly suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function by inhibiting thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and release. Simultaneously, CNS inflammation activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation, potentially leading to chronic cortisol elevation and subsequent glucocorticoid receptor desensitization.

The neuroinflammatory state further perpetuates the pathological cycle through multiple feedback mechanisms that directly contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome symptomatology. Inflammatory mediators within the CNS can impair mitochondrial function in neurons and glial cells, reducing cellular ATP production and contributing to the characteristic energy deficits observed in chronic fatigue. Additionally, neuroinflammation disrupts neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly affecting serotonin and dopamine pathways that regulate mood, motivation, and cognitive function. The inflammatory environment also promotes oxidative stress within the CNS, depleting antioxidant systems and further damaging neuronal structures. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where CNS inflammation both results from and contributes to the systemic inflammatory burden, while simultaneously impairing the central regulatory mechanisms (HPT and HPA axes) necessary for metabolic recovery and stress adaptation, ultimately manifesting as the persistent fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
