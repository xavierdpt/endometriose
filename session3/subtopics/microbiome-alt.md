# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Endometriosis patients show altered intestinal microbiome composition

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic inflammation creates a systemic inflammatory milieu that significantly impacts intestinal microbiome homeostasis through multiple interconnected mechanisms. The persistent elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, along with increased intestinal permeability mediated by zonulin and tight junction disruption, creates an environment conducive to dysbiotic bacterial shifts. This inflammatory cascade disrupts the delicate balance of commensal bacteria, typically manifesting as reduced beneficial taxa (such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species) and increased pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. The altered redox environment and compromised intestinal epithelial barrier function further facilitate bacterial translocation and endotoxin leakage, establishing a foundation for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) development.

The dysbiotic microbiome composition in endometriosis patients directly contributes to impaired gastrointestinal motility and bile acid metabolism, key factors in SIBO pathogenesis. Altered bacterial populations disrupt normal bile acid deconjugation patterns through modified β-glucuronidase and bile salt hydrolase activity, leading to bile acid sequestration and reduced antimicrobial bile acid concentrations in the small intestine. Concurrently, chronic inflammation impairs enteric nervous system function and migrating motor complex patterns, creating intestinal stasis that promotes bacterial overgrowth. The resulting SIBO amplifies endotoxin production through increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin release from gram-negative bacteria, triggering TLR4-MyD88 pathway activation and subsequent NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascades.

This microbiome-mediated amplification of systemic inflammation creates a critical link in the pathophysiological chain connecting endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. The sustained endotoxemia resulting from altered microbiome composition and SIBO activates hepatic Kupffer cells and promotes cytokine storm perpetuation, directly interfering with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function through suppression of TRH and TSH release. Additionally, bacterial endotoxins inhibit peripheral deiodinase activity (particularly DIO1 and DIO2), impairing T4-to-T3 conversion and creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite normal TSH levels. The chronic activation of the HPA axis through persistent cytokine stimulation leads to cortisol resistance and impaired glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity, while sustained neuroinflammation mediated by activated microglia disrupts central energy regulation and neurotransmitter metabolism, ultimately manifesting as the metabolic suppression and neurological symptoms characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Assessment:**

This large-scale Estonian cohort study (n=1000, including 136 endometriosis patients) presents findings that directly contradict the pathophysiological analysis presented above. Using shotgun metagenomics, the authors found no significant differences in gut microbiome composition between women with and without endometriosis across multiple analytical approaches: alpha-diversity (Shannon diversity, observed richness; all p-values > 0.05), beta-diversity (PERMANOVA, R² < 0.0007), or differential abundance of microbial species and functional pathways (all FDR p-values > 0.05 after multiple testing correction). Critically, the study also examined estrobolome-associated enzymes, including β-glucuronidase variants involved in estrogen metabolism, and found no significant differences between groups, challenging the proposed mechanism linking dysbiotic bacteria to altered bile acid metabolism and hormone regulation. The study's methodological strengths include its substantial sample size (the largest metagenome study on endometriosis to date), rigorous shotgun sequencing approach, comprehensive statistical adjustments for confounders (BMI, age, medications, stool characteristics), and sensitivity analyses excluding menopausal women. However, this contradictory evidence suggests that either the microbiome alterations proposed in endometriosis are more subtle than detectable by current methodologies, occur in specific subpopulations not captured in this Estonian cohort, or that the causal relationship between endometriosis and gut dysbiosis may be weaker than hypothesized in the pathophysiological framework above.

**Assessment:**

This systematic review by Iavarone et al. provides modest support for the pathophysiological analysis above, identifying consistent microbial alterations in endometriosis patients across six clinical trials (total n=396). The meta-analysis demonstrates significantly increased Prevotella, Blautia, and Bifidobacterium genera alongside decreased Paraprevotella, Ruminococcus, and Lachnospira (all p < 0.05), suggesting a reproducible dysbiotic pattern that aligns with the proposed inflammatory cascade. Critically, the review identifies an elevated Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in endometriosis patients compared to controls, which supports the proposed disruption of intestinal homeostasis that could facilitate SIBO development. However, the review's methodological limitations significantly constrain its evidentiary value: the included studies show substantial heterogeneity in patient populations, treatment status, and disease severity, while the small sample sizes and lack of standardized protocols limit generalizability. Most importantly, the review explicitly acknowledges its inability to establish causality, noting that "it is neither possible to determine whether gut microbial signatures are promoting or progressive factors in the pathogenesis of endometriosis." The surgical data showing increased Proteobacteria abundance (34.36% to 54.04%, p < 0.05) after hysterectomy provides intriguing evidence of bidirectional gut-endocrine interactions, but the lack of longitudinal follow-up studies prevents assessment of whether these microbial changes translate into the systemic inflammatory amplification and metabolic consequences proposed in the pathophysiological framework connecting endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Assessment:**

This Chinese study (n=40; 22 endometriosis patients, 18 controls) using 16S rRNA sequencing provides substantial support for the pathophysiological analysis above, demonstrating significant microbiome alterations that align with the proposed inflammatory cascade leading to SIBO development. The study reveals reduced alpha diversity (Shannon, Simpson, and Pielou indices; all p<0.05) in endometriosis patients compared to controls, supporting the proposed disruption of intestinal homeostasis. Critically, the findings show significantly increased Proteobacteria (p<0.001) and decreased Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes_A (p<0.001) at the phylum level, directly supporting the dysbiotic shift toward gram-negative bacteria that would enhance endotoxin production through LPS release. At the genus level, the increased abundance of Burkholderiales and Sphingomonadales with concurrent decreases in protective genera (Bacteroides_H and Roseburia; p<0.01-0.001) aligns with the proposed mechanism whereby reduced beneficial bacteria compromise bile acid metabolism and short-chain fatty acid production. The strong correlations between disease markers (CA125, CA199) and pathogenic genera (positive with Burkholderiales/Sphingomonadales, negative with Bacteroidales/Roseburia) provide biochemical evidence linking microbiome alterations to disease severity. The PICRUSt2 functional analysis showing increased xenobiotic biodegradation pathways alongside decreased vitamin/cofactor metabolism supports the proposed metabolic disruption that could impair deiodinase activity and thyroid hormone conversion. However, the study's limitations include small sample size (n=22 endometriosis patients), lack of SIBO assessment, absence of longitudinal data to establish causality, and no evaluation of systemic inflammatory markers or thyroid function to confirm the downstream metabolic consequences proposed in the pathophysiological framework connecting endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Reference 4

**Assessment:**

This Turkish study (n=28; 14 endometriosis patients, 14 controls) using 16S rRNA sequencing provides limited and contradictory evidence regarding the pathophysiological analysis above. While the study found overall similar microbiota composition between groups across gut, vaginal, and cervical sites with no significant differences in alpha-diversity (Shannon index) or beta-diversity (PCoA analysis; all p>0.05), it identified specific genus-level alterations that partially align with the proposed dysbiotic mechanisms. The complete absence of Atopobium in vaginal and cervical samples from endometriosis patients, alongside increased Gardnerella presence in cervical microbiota (67.7% vs 36.8%, p<0.05), suggests localized dysbiotic shifts that could potentially contribute to inflammatory amplification through altered immune-microbiome interactions. Critically, two patients with severe bowel endometriosis requiring segmental colon resection showed increased Escherichia/Shigella abundance in stool samples, providing modest support for the proposed connection between endometriosis severity and pathogenic gram-negative bacterial overgrowth that could enhance endotoxin production and systemic inflammation. However, the study's significant methodological limitations severely constrain its evidentiary value: the extremely small sample size (n=14 per group), focus only on severe stage 3-4 endometriosis cases, lack of SIBO assessment or measurement of systemic inflammatory markers (cytokines, endotoxin levels), and absence of functional pathway analysis prevent evaluation of whether these microbial changes translate into the proposed biochemical consequences involving bile acid metabolism disruption, deiodinase inhibition, or HPA-HPT axis suppression that would connect endometriosis-associated microbiome alterations to chronic fatigue syndrome development.

## Reference 5

**URL:** https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frph.2021.726598/pdf

**Assessment:**

This systematic review by O'Malley et al. provides indirect but relevant evidence regarding the pathophysiological analysis above through its examination of food hypersensitivities in endometriosis patients, which could theoretically result from microbiome-mediated gut dysfunction. The review identified only five studies meeting inclusion criteria from 849 publications, with only one study showing statistically significant increased non-allergic food hypersensitivity in endometriosis patients (P = 0.009), specifically to sorbitol, histamine, and gluten. However, the authors conclude that "evidence does not support the existence of a link between endometriosis and allergic or non-allergic food hypersensitivity" due to substantial methodological limitations including small sample sizes, diagnostic heterogeneity, and lack of validated assessment instruments. Critically, while the review acknowledges the substantial symptom overlap between food hypersensitivities and endometriosis-related gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, diarrhea), it does not investigate potential mechanistic links through microbiome alterations or SIBO development that could explain both conditions simultaneously. The authors explicitly note the diagnostic challenge of distinguishing between gastrointestinal manifestations of endometriosis, food hypersensitivities, and conditions like IBS, which could be explained by the shared pathophysiological pathway of chronic inflammation disrupting gut barrier function and microbiome homeostasis proposed above. However, the review's conclusion that current evidence is "scarce, non-specific, and under-powered" suggests that if microbiome-mediated food hypersensitivities do occur in endometriosis patients, they are either more subtle than current methodologies can detect or require more rigorous study designs to demonstrate the proposed mechanistic connections linking endometriosis-induced dysbiosis to systemic inflammatory amplification and metabolic consequences characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Reference 6

**URL:** https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-025-03689-0

**Assessment:**

This Chinese study (n=75; 39 early-stage, 36 late-stage endometriosis patients) using 16S rRNA sequencing provides compelling evidence supporting the pathophysiological analysis above by demonstrating progressive microbiome alterations that correlate with disease severity and symptom development. The study reveals significant microbial structural differences between early and late-stage endometriosis along PCoA2 axis (p<0.05), with late-stage patients showing increased abundance of pathogenic genera including Bartonella, Snodgrassella, and Gilliamella, while beneficial genera like Bacteroides and Prevotella were decreased, directly supporting the proposed dysbiotic shift toward gram-negative bacteria that enhances endotoxin production and systemic inflammation. Critically, the study demonstrates that late-stage patients with dysmenorrhea exhibit distinctly different gut profiles compared to other endometriosis groups, providing clinical evidence linking microbiome alterations to symptom severity as proposed in the inflammatory cascade model. The PICRUSt2 functional analysis revealing suppressed steroid biosynthesis pathways in late-stage patients aligns with the proposed mechanism whereby dysbiotic bacteria disrupt bile acid metabolism and hormone regulation, potentially contributing to the impaired deiodinase activity and thyroid hormone dysfunction described in the pathophysiological framework. However, the study's limitations include moderate sample size, focus on Chinese population limiting generalizability, lack of SIBO assessment or direct measurement of systemic inflammatory markers (cytokines, endotoxin levels), and absence of longitudinal data to establish causality between microbiome changes and the proposed downstream metabolic consequences involving HPA-HPT axis suppression and chronic fatigue syndrome development.

# Synthesis and Conclusions

## Substantiated Claims

The pathophysiological analysis receives substantial support for several core propositions. **The dysbiotic bacterial shift toward gram-negative bacteria and away from beneficial taxa** is strongly substantiated by three independent studies (References 2, 3, and 6). Reference 3 demonstrates significantly increased Proteobacteria (p<0.001) with decreased Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes_A, while Reference 6 shows increased pathogenic genera (Bartonella, Snodgrassella, Gilliamella) with decreased beneficial genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella). Reference 2's systematic review confirms this pattern across six clinical trials with elevated Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios.

**The correlation between microbiome alterations and disease severity** is convincingly demonstrated by Reference 6, which shows progressive microbial structural differences between early and late-stage endometriosis (p<0.05) and distinct gut profiles in late-stage patients with dysmenorrhea. Reference 3 further supports this through strong correlations between disease markers (CA125, CA199) and pathogenic genera abundance.

**The disruption of metabolic pathways** receives indirect support from References 3 and 6, with PICRUSt2 functional analysis showing increased xenobiotic biodegradation pathways alongside decreased vitamin/cofactor metabolism (Reference 3) and suppressed steroid biosynthesis pathways in late-stage patients (Reference 6).

## Contradicted Claims

**The fundamental premise of altered intestinal microbiome composition in endometriosis** faces direct contradiction from Reference 1, the largest and most methodologically rigorous study reviewed (n=1000, including 136 endometriosis patients). Using shotgun metagenomics, this Estonian cohort study found no significant differences in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, differential abundance of microbial species, or functional pathways (all p-values > 0.05 after multiple testing correction). Critically, this study also found no differences in estrobolome-associated enzymes, including β-glucuronidase variants, directly contradicting the proposed mechanism linking dysbiotic bacteria to altered bile acid metabolism and hormone regulation.

## Evidence Gaps Requiring Additional Research

**The causal connection between microbiome alterations and SIBO development** lacks direct evidence across all references. While the pathophysiological analysis proposes that dysbiotic shifts create conditions conducive to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, none of the reviewed studies specifically assessed SIBO presence or measured small intestinal bacterial populations. This represents a critical evidentiary gap, as the proposed mechanism relies heavily on SIBO as the amplifying factor for endotoxin production and systemic inflammation.

**The downstream metabolic consequences connecting microbiome changes to chronic fatigue syndrome** are entirely unsupported by direct evidence. No reviewed studies measured systemic inflammatory markers (cytokines, endotoxin levels), thyroid function parameters (TRH, TSH, T3/T4 conversion), HPA axis markers (cortisol, ACTH), or deiodinase activity (DIO1, DIO2) that would confirm the proposed pathophysiological chain linking dysbiotic microbiome to metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation.

**The temporal relationship and causality** remain unestablished due to the absence of longitudinal studies in all but one reference. Reference 2 provides modest evidence of bidirectional interactions through surgical data showing increased Proteobacteria after hysterectomy, but this is insufficient to determine whether microbiome alterations are causative factors or secondary consequences of endometriosis-induced inflammation.

## Resolution of Contradictory Evidence

The stark contradiction between Reference 1's null findings and the positive results from References 2, 3, and 6 may be explained by several factors: (1) **Population-specific effects** - the Estonian cohort may have different genetic, dietary, or environmental factors that mask microbiome alterations detectable in Chinese populations; (2) **Methodological sensitivity** - shotgun metagenomics (Reference 1) versus 16S rRNA sequencing (References 3, 4, 6) may capture different aspects of microbial diversity; (3) **Disease staging heterogeneity** - Reference 1 may have included predominantly early-stage cases where microbiome changes are less pronounced, as suggested by Reference 6's demonstration of progressive alterations with disease severity.

**Additional research is urgently needed** to resolve these contradictions through large-scale, multi-population longitudinal studies that directly assess SIBO prevalence, measure systemic inflammatory and metabolic markers, and evaluate the proposed downstream consequences on thyroid function and energy metabolism that would establish the mechanistic pathway connecting endometriosis-associated microbiome alterations to chronic fatigue syndrome development.

# Pathophysiological Analysis (Revised)

Current evidence suggests that endometriosis-associated intestinal microbiome alterations may be population-specific, disease stage-dependent, or methodologically contingent rather than universally present. While three independent studies demonstrate dysbiotic shifts toward gram-negative bacteria with decreased beneficial taxa (References 2, 3, 6), the largest and most methodologically rigorous investigation found no microbiome differences in an Estonian cohort of 1,000 women (Reference 1). This contradiction indicates that if endometriosis does influence intestinal microbiome composition, the effect may be subtle, confined to specific populations with particular genetic or environmental backgrounds, or most pronounced in advanced disease stages where progressive microbial structural differences correlate with symptom severity (Reference 6). The chronic inflammatory milieu characteristic of endometriosis may selectively disrupt intestinal homeostasis in susceptible individuals through cytokine-mediated effects on intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, but this disruption appears insufficient to create consistent, detectable microbiome alterations across diverse populations.

The proposed connection between endometriosis-associated microbiome changes and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) development remains entirely speculative, as none of the reviewed studies directly assessed SIBO presence or small intestinal bacterial populations. While the functional pathway disruptions identified in References 3 and 6—including impaired vitamin/cofactor metabolism, increased xenobiotic biodegradation, and suppressed steroid biosynthesis—could theoretically contribute to conditions favoring bacterial overgrowth, the absence of direct SIBO measurement represents a critical evidentiary gap. The proposed mechanism whereby dysbiotic bacteria disrupt bile acid deconjugation patterns and enteric nervous system function, thereby creating intestinal stasis conducive to bacterial overgrowth, lacks empirical support and may overstate the functional consequences of the relatively modest microbiome alterations observed in endometriosis patients. Additionally, the correlation between disease markers and pathogenic genera abundance (Reference 3) could reflect systemic inflammatory effects on bacterial growth rather than causative microbiome-mediated pathophysiology.

The hypothesized downstream metabolic consequences linking microbiome alterations to chronic fatigue syndrome through disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis remain completely unsupported by direct evidence, representing the weakest component of the pathophysiological framework. No reviewed studies measured the proposed mechanistic intermediates—systemic inflammatory markers, endotoxin levels, thyroid function parameters, HPA axis markers, or deiodinase activity—that would confirm the complex cascade from dysbiotic microbiome to metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation. The absence of longitudinal data prevents establishment of causality, and the possibility that microbiome alterations are secondary consequences rather than causative factors in endometriosis-associated systemic inflammation remains unresolved (Reference 2). While the theoretical framework connecting chronic inflammation, microbiome dysbiosis, and metabolic dysfunction has biological plausibility, the current evidence base is insufficient to support the proposed pathophysiological chain linking endometriosis-associated microbiome alterations to chronic fatigue syndrome development, necessitating comprehensive longitudinal studies with direct measurement of all proposed mechanistic components.
