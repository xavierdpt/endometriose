# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Endometriosis patients show altered intestinal microbiome composition

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic inflammation creates a systemic inflammatory milieu that significantly impacts intestinal microbiome homeostasis through multiple interconnected mechanisms. The persistent elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, along with increased intestinal permeability mediated by zonulin and tight junction disruption, creates an environment conducive to dysbiotic bacterial shifts. This inflammatory cascade disrupts the delicate balance of commensal bacteria, typically manifesting as reduced beneficial taxa (such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species) and increased pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. The altered redox environment and compromised intestinal epithelial barrier function further facilitate bacterial translocation and endotoxin leakage, establishing a foundation for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) development.

The dysbiotic microbiome composition in endometriosis patients directly contributes to impaired gastrointestinal motility and bile acid metabolism, key factors in SIBO pathogenesis. Altered bacterial populations disrupt normal bile acid deconjugation patterns through modified β-glucuronidase and bile salt hydrolase activity, leading to bile acid sequestration and reduced antimicrobial bile acid concentrations in the small intestine. Concurrently, chronic inflammation impairs enteric nervous system function and migrating motor complex patterns, creating intestinal stasis that promotes bacterial overgrowth. The resulting SIBO amplifies endotoxin production through increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin release from gram-negative bacteria, triggering TLR4-MyD88 pathway activation and subsequent NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascades.

This microbiome-mediated amplification of systemic inflammation creates a critical link in the pathophysiological chain connecting endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. The sustained endotoxemia resulting from altered microbiome composition and SIBO activates hepatic Kupffer cells and promotes cytokine storm perpetuation, directly interfering with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function through suppression of TRH and TSH release. Additionally, bacterial endotoxins inhibit peripheral deiodinase activity (particularly DIO1 and DIO2), impairing T4-to-T3 conversion and creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite normal TSH levels. The chronic activation of the HPA axis through persistent cytokine stimulation leads to cortisol resistance and impaired glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity, while sustained neuroinflammation mediated by activated microglia disrupts central energy regulation and neurotransmitter metabolism, ultimately manifesting as the metabolic suppression and neurological symptoms characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
