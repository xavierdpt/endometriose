# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Short-chain fatty acids and bile acids serve as important metabolomic biomarkers

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids represent critical metabolomic biomarkers that both reflect and contribute to the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. In healthy gut microbiota, beneficial bacteria produce SCFAs including acetate, propionate, and butyrate through fermentation of dietary fiber, which serve as primary energy sources for colonocytes, maintain intestinal barrier integrity, and exert anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of NF-ÎºB signaling and promotion of regulatory T-cell differentiation. However, in the dysbiotic state associated with endometriosis-induced SIBO, there is a characteristic shift toward pathogenic bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, leading to decreased SCFA production and altered SCFA profiles that can be detected through metabolomic analysis, serving as biomarkers for gut dysbiosis severity.

The disruption of bile acid metabolism represents another crucial biomarker pathway in this pathophysiological cascade. Bile acids, synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes and modified by gut bacteria, normally undergo enterohepatic circulation and serve as signaling molecules through farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation, regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and gut barrier function. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, bacterial overgrowth leads to premature deconjugation of bile salts and altered secondary bile acid production, resulting in measurable changes in bile acid profiles that correlate with increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation. These alterations compromise FXR-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling and contribute to the perpetuation of inflammatory cascades that ultimately impact thyroidal function and metabolic homeostasis.

Furthermore, the interconnection between SCFA depletion and bile acid dysregulation amplifies the pathophysiological impact through multiple mechanisms. Reduced butyrate availability compromises colonocyte energy metabolism and tight junction integrity, while altered bile acid signaling disrupts the gut-liver axis and contributes to hepatic inflammation that can influence thyroid hormone metabolism through cytokine-mediated suppression of deiodinase enzymes. The combined metabolomic signature of decreased beneficial SCFAs and altered bile acid profiles thus serves as both a diagnostic biomarker for the underlying gut-systemic inflammation axis and a mechanistic contributor to the progression toward chronic fatigue syndrome through sustained metabolic and neuroendocrine disruption.
