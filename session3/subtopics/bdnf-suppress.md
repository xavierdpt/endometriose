# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** BDNF signaling is suppressed contributing to cognitive impairment

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The suppression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling represents a critical neurobiological consequence of the chronic inflammatory cascade initiated by the endometriosis-SIBO complex. BDNF, a key neurotrophin essential for neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, becomes significantly downregulated through multiple interconnected pathways stemming from systemic inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which are elevated in both endometriosis and SIBO-induced endotoxemia, directly suppress BDNF gene expression through activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways and inhibition of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), the primary transcriptional regulator of BDNF. Additionally, the chronic elevation of cortisol resulting from HPA axis dysregulation further compounds BDNF suppression, as glucocorticoids directly inhibit BDNF transcription while simultaneously promoting neuroinflammatory processes that create a hostile environment for neurotrophin signaling.

The neuroinflammatory milieu generated by bacterial translocation and endotoxemia creates a secondary wave of BDNF suppression through microglial activation and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators within the central nervous system. Activated microglia produce reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines that not only directly damage neurons but also interfere with BDNF receptor (TrkB) signaling cascades, disrupting downstream pathways including PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK that are essential for neuroplasticity and cognitive function. This neuroinflammatory environment is further exacerbated by compromised blood-brain barrier integrity, a consequence of chronic systemic inflammation, which allows peripheral inflammatory mediators to directly access brain tissue and perpetuate the cycle of neuroinflammation and BDNF suppression.

The metabolic consequences of thyroidal dysfunction, particularly the reduction in free T3 levels and subsequent metabolic rate suppression, create additional barriers to BDNF synthesis and signaling. Thyroid hormones are essential co-factors for BDNF gene expression, and the inflammatory suppression of peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion significantly impairs the brain's ability to maintain adequate BDNF levels. This metabolic suppression, combined with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from chronic oxidative stress, reduces the cellular energy availability necessary for BDNF synthesis and transport, while also impairing the neuroplasticity mechanisms that depend on BDNF signaling. The resulting cognitive impairment, characterized by deficits in memory consolidation, executive function, and mental clarity, represents a direct neurobiological manifestation of the systemic pathophysiological cascade, establishing a clear mechanistic link between peripheral inflammation and central nervous system dysfunction in the endometriosis-chronic fatigue syndrome continuum.
