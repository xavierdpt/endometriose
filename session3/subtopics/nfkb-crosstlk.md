# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** NF-κB cross-talk amplifies multiple inflammatory pathways

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) represents a master transcriptional regulator of inflammatory responses, orchestrating the expression of numerous cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory mediators. In the context of endometriosis, NF-κB activation occurs through multiple convergent pathways including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling from bacterial lipopolysaccharides, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α released by activated macrophages in ectopic lesions, and oxidative stress generated by chronic inflammation. This transcription factor operates through classical and alternative pathways, with the classical pathway (RelA/p50 dimers) predominantly driving acute inflammatory responses, while the alternative pathway (RelB/p52 dimers) sustains chronic inflammatory states characteristic of endometriosis.

The cross-talk amplification mediated by NF-κB creates a pathological feed-forward loop that connects endometriosis-associated inflammation with systemic immune dysregulation. Activated NF-κB simultaneously upregulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) leading to increased prostaglandin E2 production, enhances aromatase (CYP19A1) expression promoting local estrogen synthesis, and stimulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) facilitating tissue invasion and angiogenesis. Crucially, NF-κB activation in intestinal epithelial cells compromises tight junction integrity by downregulating claudin-1 and occludin expression while upregulating zonulin release, directly contributing to increased intestinal permeability that enables bacterial translocation and SIBO development. This intestinal barrier dysfunction allows lipopolysaccharides and other bacterial antigens to reach systemic circulation, further activating NF-κB in hepatic Kupffer cells, peripheral immune cells, and hypothalamic microglia.

The systemic NF-κB activation cascade creates the critical mechanistic link between localized endometriotic inflammation and the development of chronic fatigue syndrome through neuroendocrine disruption. NF-κB-mediated cytokine production (particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) directly suppresses hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and anterior pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release, while simultaneously impairing peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism by inhibiting type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in hepatocytes. Additionally, chronic NF-κB activation in the hypothalamus disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by inducing glucocorticoid receptor resistance and aberrant corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression patterns. This neuroendocrine dysregulation, combined with NF-κB-driven mitochondrial dysfunction through inhibition of key respiratory chain complexes, establishes the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation that manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, completing the pathophysiological pathway from endometriosis to systemic metabolic dysfunction.
