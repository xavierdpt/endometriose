# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Systemic bacterial translocation occurs through compromised gut barrier in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Systemic bacterial translocation through compromised gut barrier function represents a critical mechanistic bridge in the endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue syndrome pathway. In endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production can extend beyond the reproductive organs to affect intestinal epithelial integrity. The inflammatory milieu disrupts tight junction proteins, particularly claudin-1 and occludin, while simultaneously increasing intestinal permeability through zonulin-mediated pathways. This compromised gut barrier allows normally compartmentalized gram-negative bacteria and their associated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins to translocate across the intestinal epithelium into systemic circulation, creating a state of metabolic endotoxemia.

The translocation of bacterial products, particularly LPS and flagellin, triggers robust activation of pattern recognition receptors, specifically Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR5, on immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and Kupffer cells. This recognition event initiates the MyD88-dependent signaling cascade, leading to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and subsequent transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. The resulting cytokine storm, characterized by elevated IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, creates a positive feedback loop that further compromises intestinal barrier function while simultaneously amplifying systemic inflammation. This bacterial translocation-induced inflammatory state can activate the complement system and promote oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase activation, contributing to endothelial dysfunction and tissue damage.

The systemic inflammatory burden generated by bacterial translocation serves as a powerful stimulus for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, while simultaneously creating conditions that promote thyroidal dysfunction. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β and TNF-α, can suppress thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis in the hypothalamus and inhibit peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the active triiodothyronine (T3) through suppression of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity. Furthermore, chronic exposure to bacterial endotoxins can induce glucocorticoid resistance through impaired glucocorticoid receptor function, perpetuating the inflammatory state despite elevated cortisol levels. This creates a pathophysiological foundation for metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation through microglial activation, and the development of chronic fatigue syndrome, as the persistent inflammatory signaling disrupts cellular energy metabolism and neurotransmitter balance essential for normal energy homeostasis.
