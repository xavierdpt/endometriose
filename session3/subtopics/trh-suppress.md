# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** TRH gene expression is suppressed by inflammation in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The suppression of TRH gene expression by inflammatory mediators represents a critical mechanistic link in the endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathophysiological cascade. Chronic inflammation associated with endometriosis generates elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which directly interfere with hypothalamic TRH synthesis and release. These cytokines activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and other transcriptional repressors that downregulate TRH gene expression in paraventricular nucleus neurons. Additionally, inflammatory mediators enhance the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress responses, leading to increased cortisol production, which further suppresses TRH synthesis through negative feedback mechanisms on hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons that modulate TRH-producing cells.

This inflammatory suppression of TRH creates a state of central hypothyroidism that compounds the peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism disruptions described in the global thesis. Reduced TRH leads to diminished thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release from anterior pituitary thyrotrophs, resulting in decreased T4 production by the thyroid gland. When combined with SIBO-mediated endotoxemia that inhibits peripheral deiodinase enzymes (particularly DIO1 and DIO2), the dual assault on both central and peripheral thyroid hormone pathways creates a profound state of tissue hypothyroidism despite potentially normal circulating thyroid hormone levels.

The TRH suppression mechanism establishes a self-perpetuating pathological cycle that directly supports the development of chronic fatigue syndrome. Reduced thyroidal signaling impairs cellular mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, and overall metabolic rate, leading to the characteristic energy depletion observed in chronic fatigue. Furthermore, diminished thyroid hormone availability compromises immune system regulation, potentially allowing continued SIBO proliferation and sustained endotoxemic inflammation. This creates a positive feedback loop where inflammation suppresses TRH, reducing thyroidal function, which impairs immune clearance mechanisms, allowing continued inflammatory burden that further suppresses TRH expression, thus perpetuating the entire pathological cascade from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome.
