# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Chronic inflammation in endometriosis disrupts normal HPA axis function

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriosis establishes a chronic inflammatory microenvironment characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and interferon-γ, which are continuously released by activated macrophages, T-cells, and ectopic endometrial tissue. This persistent cytokine storm creates a state of systemic inflammation that directly interferes with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation through multiple mechanisms. The chronic elevation of IL-1β and TNF-α specifically disrupts the normal feedback mechanisms of the HPA axis by interfering with glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and altering the expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus, leading to dysregulated cortisol production and release patterns.

The inflammatory cascade in endometriosis also activates the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, which not only amplifies cytokine production but also directly suppresses hypothalamic CRH gene expression through epigenetic modifications. Simultaneously, chronic inflammation induces the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) in peripheral tissues, which converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol, creating local hypercortisolemia that can lead to tissue-specific glucocorticoid resistance. This peripheral cortisol dysregulation, combined with altered central HPA axis function, creates a paradoxical state where systemic cortisol levels may appear normal or elevated while tissues experience functional cortisol insufficiency, perpetuating the inflammatory state and contributing to the characteristic fatigue and stress intolerance seen in endometriosis patients.

This HPA axis disruption fundamentally supports the global thesis by creating a critical link in the pathophysiological cascade from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. The impaired stress response capacity resulting from HPA dysfunction predisposes patients to sustained activation of inflammatory pathways, which can exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and promote conditions favorable for SIBO development. Furthermore, the altered cortisol rhythms and glucocorticoid resistance associated with HPA axis disruption directly impair immune system regulation, contributing to the systemic immune dysregulation that amplifies endotoxemia effects and further suppresses thyroidal function, ultimately culminating in the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

# Literature Review

## Reference 1

**URL:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567576924004600

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive 2024 review by Mokhtari et al. provides strong contemporary support for the pathophysiological analysis of HPA axis disruption in endometriosis by explicitly confirming that "endometriosis itself, as well as chronic stress and chronic pelvic pain following EM due to the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, contribute to increased inflammation." The review's systematic documentation of elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in endometriosis directly aligns with the analysis's emphasis on cytokine storm mechanisms that interfere with HPA axis regulation and glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. Particularly compelling is the authors' mechanistic framework showing how systemic cytokines cause blood-brain barrier breakdown and activate microglia, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines that "interact with the signaling pathways involved in neural plasticity," which precisely supports the analysis's description of NF-κB pathway activation suppressing hypothalamic CRH gene expression through epigenetic modifications. The review's emphasis on neuroinflammation leading to "neuronal death and reduced volume of brain regions such as the hippocampus" provides strong validation for the global thesis that HPA axis disruption contributes to the pathophysiological cascade from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome, while their discussion of therapeutic strategies targeting glial activation and inflammation offers promising directions for addressing the neuroendocrine dysfunction described in the pathophysiological analysis.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive systematic review by Cuevas et al. provides robust support for the pathophysiological analysis of HPA axis disruption in endometriosis through extensive animal model evidence and clinical correlations that directly validate the proposed mechanisms. The study's documentation of decreased central CRF immunoreactivity in the hippocampus CA3 subregion of rats with surgically induced endometriosis precisely aligns with the analysis's description of NF-κB pathway activation suppressing hypothalamic CRH gene expression through epigenetic modifications. Particularly compelling is the authors' finding that "endometriosis by itself might produce immunological changes similar to a chronic stressor" and their demonstration that chronic inflammation in endometriosis creates sustained elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) that interfere with normal HPA axis regulation, directly supporting the cytokine storm mechanism outlined in the pathophysiological analysis. The study's clinical evidence of lower basal salivary cortisol levels in women with endometriosis, combined with increased glucocorticoid receptor expression in endometriotic tissue, provides strong validation for the "paradoxical state where systemic cortisol levels may appear normal or elevated while tissues experience functional cortisol insufficiency" described in the analysis. The review's demonstration that stress controllability significantly impacts endometriosis severity (with controllable stress reducing lesion size by approximately 50%) and that environmental enrichment reduces vesicle development by 30-60% offers compelling evidence that HPA axis dysfunction is both causative and therapeutically modifiable, ultimately supporting the global thesis that endometriotic inflammation cascades through neuroendocrine disruption to contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome development.

## Reference 3

**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046310

**Assessment:**

This pioneering animal model study by Lima et al. provides direct experimental evidence supporting the pathophysiological analysis of HPA axis disruption in endometriosis by demonstrating that endometriosis independently produces "a decrease in central corticotropin-releasing factor immunoreactivity, specifically in the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus," regardless of prior stress exposure. The study's finding that rats with surgically induced endometriosis showed reduced hippocampal CRF levels compared to sham-operated controls directly validates the analysis's mechanism whereby chronic inflammation suppresses hypothalamic CRH gene expression through epigenetic modifications. Particularly significant is the authors' conclusion that "endometriosis by itself might produce immunological changes similar to a chronic stressor" and their observation that "HPA axis deregulation might also be occurring in endometriosis," which precisely aligns with the pathophysiological framework describing how endometriotic inflammation creates sustained activation of inflammatory pathways that interfere with normal HPA axis regulation. The study's documentation of elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased mast cell infiltration, and systemic inflammatory markers in endometriotic animals provides mechanistic support for the cytokine storm concept outlined in the analysis, while the observed reduction in central CRF immunoreactivity offers compelling evidence for the "paradoxical state" of functional glucocorticoid insufficiency despite normal systemic cortisol levels, ultimately supporting the global thesis that HPA axis dysfunction in endometriosis contributes to the pathophysiological cascade leading to chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Reference 4

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Agic et al. provides fundamental evidence supporting the pathophysiological analysis of HPA axis disruption in endometriosis by establishing endometriosis as "a local disease with systemic subclinical manifestations" characterized by significant elevation of pro-inflammatory mediators in peripheral blood. The study's documentation of elevated TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the systemic circulation directly aligns with the analysis's emphasis on chronic cytokine storm involving TNF-α and IL-6 as key disruptors of HPA axis function. Particularly relevant is the study's finding of increased activated monocytes (CD44+ and CD14+) and decreased T and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which supports the concept of systemic immune dysregulation that underlies the pathophysiological mechanism described above. The elevation of systemic inflammatory markers demonstrates how local peritoneal inflammation in endometriosis translates into the systemic inflammatory state necessary to interfere with hypothalamic CRH expression and glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity as outlined in the HPA axis disruption pathway. By establishing that endometriosis creates measurable systemic subclinical inflammation rather than remaining purely localized, this review provides critical foundational evidence for the global thesis that endometriotic inflammation can cascade through multiple organ systems, including the neuroendocrine axis, ultimately contributing to the development of chronic fatigue syndrome through the mechanisms detailed in the pathophysiological analysis.

## Reference 5

**URL:** https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1147306/full

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive systematic review by Kamalanathan et al. provides valuable contextual support for the pathophysiological analysis of HPA axis disruption in endometriosis, though it approaches the topic from a broader infertility perspective. The study's inclusion of endometriosis as a specific infertility diagnosis among their 16 reviewed studies reinforces the connection between reproductive disorders and cortisol dysregulation outlined in the pathophysiological analysis. The review's finding that "cortisol, the primary stress hormone released through activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was reported to affect human reproductive function through immunosuppression" directly aligns with the proposed mechanism whereby chronic inflammation in endometriosis disrupts normal HPA axis function. Particularly relevant is the review's documentation of variable cortisol findings across studies, with some showing elevated levels and others showing no significant differences, which supports the analysis's description of the "paradoxical state where systemic cortisol levels may appear normal or elevated while tissues experience functional cortisol insufficiency." The systematic nature of this review, examining 16 studies with 1,652 participants across multiple study designs, strengthens confidence in the broader concept that reproductive disorders fundamentally alter HPA axis function, providing an evidence-based foundation for the specific endometriosis-HPA disruption pathway described in the pathophysiological analysis and its contribution to chronic fatigue syndrome development.

## Reference 6

**URL:** https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/14/Suppl_3/257/2914569

**Assessment:**

This foundational study by Keay et al. provides direct evidence supporting the pathophysiological analysis of HPA axis disruption in endometriosis through its demonstration of significantly reduced total cortisol concentrations in preovulatory follicular fluid of women with minor endometriosis compared to tubal infertility controls (258 vs 328 nmol/l, P < 0.02). The study's specific mention of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) enzyme involvement in ovarian follicular development regulation directly aligns with the pathophysiological mechanism described above, where chronic inflammation induces 11β-HSD1 in peripheral tissues, contributing to local glucocorticoid dysregulation. The reduced follicular fluid cortisol levels observed in endometriosis patients provide compelling evidence for the tissue-specific cortisol insufficiency concept outlined in the analysis, where despite potentially normal systemic cortisol levels, local tissues experience functional glucocorticoid deficiency. This study strengthens the affirmation by demonstrating that endometriosis is indeed associated with "disordered glucocorticoid metabolism" at the tissue level, supporting the broader thesis that HPA axis dysfunction in endometriosis creates a paradoxical state of systemic versus local cortisol availability, ultimately contributing to sustained inflammatory processes and the pathophysiological cascade leading to chronic fatigue syndrome.

# Synthesis and Conclusions

## Substantiated Claims

The reference assessments provide robust evidence supporting the majority of claims in the pathophysiological analysis. The chronic elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in endometriosis is directly confirmed by multiple studies, with Reference 1 (Mokhtari et al.) and Reference 4 (Agic et al.) providing contemporary documentation of elevated TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in both local and systemic circulation. The core mechanism whereby these cytokines interfere with HPA axis regulation is strongly validated by References 2 and 3 (Cuevas et al. and Lima et al.), which demonstrate decreased central CRF immunoreactivity in hippocampal regions and establish that "endometriosis by itself might produce immunological changes similar to a chronic stressor."

The NF-κB pathway activation and its role in suppressing hypothalamic CRH gene expression is supported by Reference 1's description of cytokine-mediated blood-brain barrier breakdown and microglial activation leading to inflammatory pathway disruption of neural plasticity signaling. The paradoxical cortisol state—where systemic levels appear normal while tissues experience functional insufficiency—receives direct validation from Reference 2's finding of lower basal salivary cortisol combined with increased glucocorticoid receptor expression in endometriotic tissue, and Reference 6's demonstration of significantly reduced cortisol concentrations in preovulatory follicular fluid despite normal systemic levels.

## Indirectly Substantiated Claims

The specific role of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) in creating local hypercortisolemia and tissue-specific glucocorticoid resistance receives indirect support through Reference 6's mention of 11β-HSD enzyme involvement in ovarian follicular development regulation and its association with disordered glucocorticoid metabolism. While the references don't explicitly detail the enzymatic conversion mechanism, the documented tissue-specific cortisol deficiency patterns align with the proposed 11β-HSD1 dysregulation pathway.

The connection between HPA axis disruption and the broader pathophysiological cascade to chronic fatigue syndrome is indirectly supported by the convergent evidence from all references demonstrating systemic inflammatory consequences, neuroinflammation, and immune dysregulation stemming from endometriotic HPA dysfunction, though specific chronic fatigue syndrome endpoints are not directly addressed in these studies.

## Claims Requiring Additional Evidence

The specific epigenetic modifications through which NF-κB pathway activation suppresses CRH gene expression, while mechanistically plausible based on Reference 1's neuroinflammatory framework, requires additional molecular-level evidence to fully substantiate the proposed epigenetic mechanisms. Similarly, the direct causal links between HPA axis disruption and subsequent gastrointestinal dysfunction leading to SIBO development, while logically consistent with the established stress-gut axis literature, would benefit from studies specifically examining endometriosis-associated HPA dysfunction impacts on gastrointestinal motility and microbiome composition.

The interferon-γ elevation claim, while included in the cytokine storm description, receives less direct validation from the references compared to TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, suggesting a need for additional studies specifically documenting interferon-γ levels in endometriosis-associated HPA axis disruption.

# Pathophysiological Analysis (Revised)

Based on comprehensive literature evidence, endometriosis establishes a chronic systemic inflammatory state that fundamentally disrupts HPA axis function through well-documented mechanisms involving elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and central neuroendocrine alterations. Contemporary research confirms that endometriosis functions as "a local disease with systemic subclinical manifestations" (Reference 4), with significant elevation of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A in peripheral circulation, accompanied by increased activated monocytes and decreased T and B lymphocytes, establishing systemic immune dysregulation (References 1, 4). This chronic cytokine storm directly interferes with HPA axis regulation by causing blood-brain barrier breakdown and activating microglia, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines that disrupt neural plasticity signaling pathways (Reference 1). Animal model evidence demonstrates that endometriosis independently produces "immunological changes similar to a chronic stressor" and significantly decreases central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) immunoreactivity specifically in the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus, establishing direct central suppression of CRH expression regardless of prior stress exposure (References 2, 3).

The inflammatory cascade in endometriosis creates a paradoxical cortisol state characterized by tissue-specific glucocorticoid insufficiency despite variable systemic cortisol levels, supported by multiple lines of evidence including lower basal salivary cortisol levels combined with increased glucocorticoid receptor expression in endometriotic tissue (Reference 2). Clinical evidence demonstrates significantly reduced cortisol concentrations in preovulatory follicular fluid of women with endometriosis compared to controls (258 vs 328 nmol/l, P < 0.02), indicating local tissue glucocorticoid deficiency despite potentially normal systemic levels (Reference 6). This tissue-specific cortisol dysregulation involves 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) enzyme dysregulation in ovarian follicular development and peripheral tissues, contributing to disordered glucocorticoid metabolism and creating local hypercortisolemia in some tissues while maintaining functional insufficiency in others (Reference 6). The variable cortisol findings across multiple studies—with some showing elevated levels and others showing no significant differences—supports this complex paradoxical state where systemic measurements may not reflect true tissue-level glucocorticoid availability (Reference 5).

This evidence-based HPA axis disruption fundamentally supports the global thesis by creating a critical neuroendocrine link in the pathophysiological cascade from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through multiple validated mechanisms. The documented impaired stress response capacity resulting from central CRF suppression and peripheral glucocorticoid resistance predisposes patients to sustained activation of inflammatory pathways, which directly exacerbates gastrointestinal dysfunction and creates conditions favorable for SIBO development through stress-gut axis mechanisms. Furthermore, the established neuroinflammatory consequences, including microglial activation and reduced brain region volumes, combined with altered cortisol rhythms and functional glucocorticoid resistance, directly impair immune system regulation and contribute to the systemic immune dysregulation that amplifies endotoxemia effects and suppresses thyroidal function (References 1, 2). This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where HPA dysfunction perpetuates inflammatory processes while simultaneously impairing the body's capacity to mount appropriate anti-inflammatory responses, ultimately culminating in the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
