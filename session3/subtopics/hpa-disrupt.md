# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Chronic inflammation in endometriosis disrupts normal HPA axis function

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriosis establishes a chronic inflammatory microenvironment characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and interferon-γ, which are continuously released by activated macrophages, T-cells, and ectopic endometrial tissue. This persistent cytokine storm creates a state of systemic inflammation that directly interferes with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation through multiple mechanisms. The chronic elevation of IL-1β and TNF-α specifically disrupts the normal feedback mechanisms of the HPA axis by interfering with glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and altering the expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus, leading to dysregulated cortisol production and release patterns.

The inflammatory cascade in endometriosis also activates the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, which not only amplifies cytokine production but also directly suppresses hypothalamic CRH gene expression through epigenetic modifications. Simultaneously, chronic inflammation induces the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) in peripheral tissues, which converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol, creating local hypercortisolemia that can lead to tissue-specific glucocorticoid resistance. This peripheral cortisol dysregulation, combined with altered central HPA axis function, creates a paradoxical state where systemic cortisol levels may appear normal or elevated while tissues experience functional cortisol insufficiency, perpetuating the inflammatory state and contributing to the characteristic fatigue and stress intolerance seen in endometriosis patients.

This HPA axis disruption fundamentally supports the global thesis by creating a critical link in the pathophysiological cascade from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. The impaired stress response capacity resulting from HPA dysfunction predisposes patients to sustained activation of inflammatory pathways, which can exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and promote conditions favorable for SIBO development. Furthermore, the altered cortisol rhythms and glucocorticoid resistance associated with HPA axis disruption directly impair immune system regulation, contributing to the systemic immune dysregulation that amplifies endotoxemia effects and further suppresses thyroidal function, ultimately culminating in the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
