# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Macrophages are recruited to endometriotic lesions through prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Macrophage recruitment to endometriotic lesions through prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms represents a fundamental initiating event in the inflammatory cascade that ultimately contributes to the development of chronic fatigue syndrome. Ectopic endometrial tissue exhibits aberrant cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, leading to excessive production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other inflammatory prostaglandins. These bioactive lipid mediators function as potent chemoattractants, creating concentration gradients that guide circulating monocytes toward endometriotic implants, where they differentiate into tissue macrophages and become phenotypically activated.

Once recruited and activated within the endometriotic microenvironment, these macrophages undergo a complex polarization process that shifts toward a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This polarization is sustained by the prostaglandin-rich milieu and results in amplified production of key inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The activated macrophages also upregulate additional COX-2 expression, creating a positive feedback loop that perpetuates prostaglandin synthesis and maintains the inflammatory state. This local inflammatory amplification contributes to the systemic cytokine burden that characterizes the endometriosis-associated inflammatory phenotype.

The prostaglandin-mediated macrophage recruitment mechanism directly supports the global thesis by establishing the foundational inflammatory processes that subsequently cascade through multiple physiological systems. The chronic, low-grade inflammation initiated by macrophage activation at endometriotic sites provides the inflammatory substrate necessary to disrupt gastrointestinal barrier function, promote bacterial translocation, and create the conditions favorable for SIBO development. Furthermore, the systemic release of inflammatory mediators from activated macrophages contributes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis suppression and peripheral thyroid hormone resistance that ultimately manifest as metabolic dysfunction and chronic fatigue. This macrophage-driven inflammatory amplification thus serves as a critical early step in the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome.
