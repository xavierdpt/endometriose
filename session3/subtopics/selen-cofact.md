# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Selenium-dependent deiodinase cofactor is depleted in chronic inflammation

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Selenium serves as an essential cofactor for selenocysteine-containing enzymes, most notably the iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3) that are critical for thyroid hormone metabolism and peripheral tissue activation. In the context of chronic inflammatory conditions such as endometriosis, selenium becomes increasingly sequestered and depleted through multiple mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 upregulate acute-phase protein synthesis, particularly selenoprotein P, which redistributes selenium away from peripheral tissues toward hepatic storage. Simultaneously, chronic oxidative stress associated with endometriotic lesions and systemic inflammation increases the demand for selenium-dependent antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidases, further competing with deiodinase enzymes for available selenium cofactor.

The depletion of selenium cofactor critically impairs the function of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) in hepatic and renal tissues, which is responsible for the majority of peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion. This enzymatic dysfunction creates a state of relative T3 deficiency despite potentially normal or even elevated T4 levels, contributing to the non-thyroidal illness syndrome commonly observed in chronic inflammatory states. The reduction in active T3 availability directly suppresses mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, cellular ATP synthesis, and basal metabolic rate, establishing the metabolic foundation for chronic fatigue symptomatology.

Furthermore, selenium depletion affects type 2 deiodinase (DIO2) activity in hypothalamic tissues, disrupting local T3 production necessary for proper TRH synthesis and release. This creates a paradoxical situation where peripheral T3 deficiency coexists with central hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis suppression, perpetuating the cycle of metabolic dysfunction. The concurrent impairment of selenium-dependent immune regulatory mechanisms, including reduced T regulatory cell function and compromised resolution of inflammatory responses, maintains the chronic inflammatory state that continues to sequester selenium, creating a self-reinforcing pathological cycle that directly supports the progression from endometriosis-associated inflammation to chronic fatigue syndrome.
