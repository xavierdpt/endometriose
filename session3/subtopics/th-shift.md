# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Endometriosis is characterized by a shift from Th1 to Th2/Th17 immune dominance

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The immunological shift from Th1 to Th2/Th17 dominance in endometriosis represents a fundamental alteration in adaptive immunity that directly facilitates the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. Under normal conditions, Th1 cells produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) to promote cellular immunity and macrophage activation for effective tissue surveillance. However, in endometriosis, the chronic inflammatory milieu driven by ectopic endometrial tissue promotes differentiation toward Th2 and Th17 phenotypes. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which enhance humoral immunity and promote tissue remodeling, while Th17 cells produce IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, creating a pro-inflammatory environment that supports angiogenesis and tissue invasion. This shift impairs the normal cytotoxic response against aberrant endometrial cells, allowing ectopic lesions to establish and proliferate while simultaneously creating systemic inflammatory conditions.

The Th2/Th17 dominance directly contributes to gastrointestinal dysfunction through multiple biochemical pathways that predispose to SIBO development. IL-17A and IL-22 from Th17 cells disrupt intestinal epithelial barrier function by downregulating tight junction proteins including claudin-1 and occludin, while simultaneously promoting intestinal mucin production that can alter gut motility patterns. Th2-derived IL-4 and IL-13 induce goblet cell hyperplasia and increased mucus secretion, potentially contributing to small intestinal stasis and bacterial overgrowth. Furthermore, IL-17A stimulates neutrophil recruitment and activation, leading to release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and myeloperoxidase, which can damage intestinal epithelium and further compromise barrier integrity. The resulting increased intestinal permeability facilitates bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption, amplifying systemic inflammatory burden through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin exposure.

The systemic inflammatory amplification resulting from this immune shift creates the foundation for hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis suppression and metabolic dysfunction characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. Th17-derived IL-17A and Th2-derived IL-4 both activate the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to increased production of acute-phase proteins including C-reactive protein (CRP) and suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) synthesis in the anterior pituitary. Additionally, these cytokines inhibit type-1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in peripheral tissues, reducing conversion of T4 to active T3 and promoting reverse T3 formation, effectively creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite normal circulating T4 levels. The chronic elevation of IL-17A also promotes microglial activation in the central nervous system, leading to neuroinflammation and disruption of normal neurotransmitter metabolism, while Th2 cytokines contribute to hepatic dysfunction and impaired detoxification capacity. This multi-system dysregulation creates the metabolic suppression, cognitive dysfunction, and energy depletion that characterizes chronic fatigue syndrome, establishing a self-reinforcing cycle where immune dysregulation perpetuates the very conditions that maintain the pathological Th1/Th2/Th17 imbalance.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Lu et al. (2023) provides strong supportive evidence for the Th1 to Th2/Th17 immune shift in endometriosis, directly corroborating the pathophysiological analysis presented above. The authors explicitly document that "TH2, TH17, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been reported to be highly expressed in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis," confirming the fundamental premise of immune dominance shift. The reference validates specific mechanistic pathways described in our analysis, particularly noting that "Th2-related cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and TSLP) and IL-17a secreted by TH17 cells have been described as aggravators for endometriosis development, given their inflammation-aggravating and endometrial cell proliferation-promoting effects." This directly supports the described biochemical cascade involving IL-4, IL-13, IL-17A, and IL-22 in promoting tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and barrier dysfunction. The review's discussion of therapeutic interventions targeting this immune imbalance, including treatments that modulate Th1/Th2 ratios and inhibit IL-17A signaling, further validates the clinical relevance of this pathophysiological pathway. The quality of evidence is substantial, representing a systematic review of immunotherapeutic approaches with extensive citations to primary research, though the authors acknowledge that "information on the clinical application of immunotherapy in endometriosis is very limited," indicating that while the mechanistic understanding is solid, therapeutic translation remains in development.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Ziętek et al. (2022) provides robust supporting evidence for the Th1 to Th2/Th17 immune shift in endometriosis, directly validating the core pathophysiological mechanisms described in the analysis above. The authors explicitly state that "the imbalance between Th1/Th2 cells leads to abnormal cytokine secretion and inflammation, which continues to induce lesion progression," confirming the fundamental premise of immune dominance shift. The review provides particularly strong evidence for Th2 polarization, noting that "due to the increased concentrations of cytokines typical of Th2 lymphocytes in the plasma and the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis, the disease was characterized as polarized towards this particular cellular response." Critical support for the Th17 component comes from their documentation that "the percentage of Th17 cells in the peritoneal fluid of patients is increased and related to the stage of the disease," with "higher levels of IL-17" promoting "endometriosis by stimulating the production of cytokines that induce angiogenesis and inflammation." The review validates specific mechanistic pathways described in the analysis, including IL-17's role in neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory amplification, though it notes that "the typical Th2 response, which is physiologically associated with healing and fibrosis, has not been fully observed in the context of endometriosis," suggesting additional complexity in the immune dysregulation. The evidence quality is substantial, representing a systematic review of immune cell dysfunction with extensive primary research citations, though the authors acknowledge limitations in translating mechanistic understanding to therapeutic applications.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive Mendelian randomization study by the authors (2024) provides robust genetic evidence supporting immune system dysregulation in endometriosis, while offering limited direct validation of the specific Th1 to Th2/Th17 dominance shift described in the pathophysiological analysis above. The study's strength lies in its unprecedented scope, analyzing 731 immune cell phenotypes across 8,288 endometriosis cases and 68,969 controls using genetic variants as instrumental variables to establish causal relationships rather than mere associations. The authors explicitly acknowledge that "an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells" has been reported in endometriosis, providing foundational support for the immune shift hypothesis. Their findings of 22 immune phenotypes associated with increased endometriosis risk, including several T cell populations and regulatory T cells (Tregs), align with the described dysregulation that could facilitate Th2/Th17 dominance. Particularly relevant is their discovery that certain CD25+ regulatory populations show protective effects, which could relate to the impaired regulatory control that allows pathological T helper shifts to persist. The bidirectional analysis revealing that endometriosis itself influences 11 immune phenotypes supports the concept of self-reinforcing immune dysfunction described in the pathophysiological cascade. However, the study's methodology, while methodologically rigorous for establishing genetic causation, does not directly measure cytokine production (IL-4, IL-17A, IFN-gamma) or functional T helper cell differentiation that would definitively confirm the Th1 to Th2/Th17 shift, instead providing upstream genetic evidence for immune system involvement that creates the biological foundation for such functional alterations to occur.

**Assessment:**

This prospective study by Podgaec et al. (2010) provides a nuanced perspective on the Th1 to Th2/Th17 immune shift in endometriosis, presenting evidence that partially challenges the straightforward dominance shift described in the pathophysiological analysis above. The study analyzed 65 endometriosis patients versus 33 controls, measuring IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma in both peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid. Notably, the authors found elevated TNF-alpha in patients with deep dyspareunia (65.5% had deep infiltrating endometriosis) and increased IL-2 in peritoneal fluid of infertile patients (63.5% with deep endometriosis), leading them to conclude that "there is a Th1 response pattern that may be associated with deeply infiltrating endometriosis." This finding appears to contradict the proposed Th2/Th17 dominance, suggesting instead that deep endometriosis may actually involve enhanced Th1 activity. However, the study also revealed elevated IL-10 (a Th2 cytokine) in ovarian endometriosis and acknowledged the complexity of immune responses, noting that endometriosis involves "co-existence of both responses." The authors' previous work, referenced in this paper, showed "a shift towards Th2 immune response despite increased IFN-gamma concentrations," indicating that the immune dysregulation in endometriosis may be more complex than a simple dominance shift. The quality of evidence is solid, with appropriate controls and validated cytokine measurement techniques, though the study is limited by sample size variability and the inability to obtain peritoneal fluid from all patients. This research suggests that the immune dysfunction in endometriosis may involve context-dependent activation of different T helper pathways, with deep infiltrating disease potentially maintaining or even enhancing certain Th1 responses while overall systemic immunity shifts toward Th2/Th17 dominance, creating a complex immune dysregulation that could still facilitate the gastrointestinal and systemic inflammatory pathways described in the main analysis.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Giudice et al. (2024) provides limited direct evidence for the specific Th1 to Th2/Th17 immune shift described in the pathophysiological analysis, but offers important contextual support for the systemic inflammatory nature of endometriosis that underlies this immune dysregulation. The authors explicitly acknowledge that "central to its pathophysiology are enhanced estrogen and diminished progesterone signaling, inflammation in the eutopic endometrium, disease in the pelvis, and systemically, and fibrosis in ectopic sites," confirming the fundamental premise that endometriosis involves systemic inflammatory processes that could facilitate the immune dominance shift. The review's focus on "real world perspectives" and the acknowledgment that endometriosis affects multiple organ systems, including gastrointestinal involvement in 7-37% of patients with bowel endometriosis, indirectly supports the proposed pathway linking immune dysregulation to gastrointestinal dysfunction and SIBO development. However, the manuscript primarily emphasizes diagnostic classification systems and technological approaches rather than detailed immunological mechanisms, noting that "several theories exist to explain its pathogenesis" and that "it is likely that different mechanisms occur in different patients." While this suggests heterogeneity in immune responses that could include the described Th1/Th2/Th17 shift, the authors do not specifically examine T helper cell populations or cytokine profiles. The quality of evidence is substantial as a comprehensive review from leading experts in the field, though its relevance to the specific immune dominance hypothesis is indirect, providing more support for the systemic inflammatory foundation that enables such immune shifts rather than direct validation of the Th1 to Th2/Th17 transition itself.

## Reference 6

**URL:** https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/14/1/58

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review provides strong mechanistic support for the Th1 to Th2/Th17 immune shift described in the pathophysiological analysis, with particular strength in elucidating estrogen-mediated pathways underlying this transition. The authors explicitly confirm that "low E2 levels favor the Th1 phenotype, associated with cell-mediated immunity and inflammation, while higher physiological doses promote the Th2 phenotype, linked to antibody production and anti-inflammatory responses," directly validating the hormonal mechanism driving the immune dominance shift in endometriosis. Critical support for Th17 involvement comes from their documentation that "studies indicate a strong correlation between elevated Th17 cells, along with increased IL-17 in peritoneal fluid and worsened inflammatory profiles," with IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-21 promoting "cell survival by conferring resistance to NK cell cytotoxicity" and driving "angiogenesis and perpetuation of inflammatory processes." The review provides particularly valuable mechanistic detail regarding how this immune shift facilitates gastrointestinal dysfunction, noting that Th17 cells are crucial for "immune responses and tissue inflammation, particularly against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens," which could contribute to altered gut microbiome dynamics and SIBO development described in the pathophysiological cascade. Additionally, the authors' finding that "in advanced stages, the Th2 response predominates, elevating the levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13, while Th1 cytokines persist throughout the disease" provides nuanced evidence that the immune shift may be progressive and context-dependent, supporting the complex inflammatory milieu that enables both local tissue invasion and systemic inflammatory amplification. The evidence quality is substantial, representing a systematic literature review with extensive primary research integration, though the authors acknowledge that "the precise effects of Th1/Th2 differentiation on the condition is not yet clear," indicating that while the mechanistic framework is well-supported, therapeutic implications remain under investigation.
