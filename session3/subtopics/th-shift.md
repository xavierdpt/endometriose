# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Endometriosis is characterized by a shift from Th1 to Th2/Th17 immune dominance

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The immunological shift from Th1 to Th2/Th17 dominance in endometriosis represents a fundamental alteration in adaptive immunity that directly facilitates the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. Under normal conditions, Th1 cells produce interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) to promote cellular immunity and macrophage activation for effective tissue surveillance. However, in endometriosis, the chronic inflammatory milieu driven by ectopic endometrial tissue promotes differentiation toward Th2 and Th17 phenotypes. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which enhance humoral immunity and promote tissue remodeling, while Th17 cells produce IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, creating a pro-inflammatory environment that supports angiogenesis and tissue invasion. This shift impairs the normal cytotoxic response against aberrant endometrial cells, allowing ectopic lesions to establish and proliferate while simultaneously creating systemic inflammatory conditions.

The Th2/Th17 dominance directly contributes to gastrointestinal dysfunction through multiple biochemical pathways that predispose to SIBO development. IL-17A and IL-22 from Th17 cells disrupt intestinal epithelial barrier function by downregulating tight junction proteins including claudin-1 and occludin, while simultaneously promoting intestinal mucin production that can alter gut motility patterns. Th2-derived IL-4 and IL-13 induce goblet cell hyperplasia and increased mucus secretion, potentially contributing to small intestinal stasis and bacterial overgrowth. Furthermore, IL-17A stimulates neutrophil recruitment and activation, leading to release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and myeloperoxidase, which can damage intestinal epithelium and further compromise barrier integrity. The resulting increased intestinal permeability facilitates bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption, amplifying systemic inflammatory burden through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin exposure.

The systemic inflammatory amplification resulting from this immune shift creates the foundation for hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis suppression and metabolic dysfunction characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. Th17-derived IL-17A and Th2-derived IL-4 both activate the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to increased production of acute-phase proteins including C-reactive protein (CRP) and suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) synthesis in the anterior pituitary. Additionally, these cytokines inhibit type-1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in peripheral tissues, reducing conversion of T4 to active T3 and promoting reverse T3 formation, effectively creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite normal circulating T4 levels. The chronic elevation of IL-17A also promotes microglial activation in the central nervous system, leading to neuroinflammation and disruption of normal neurotransmitter metabolism, while Th2 cytokines contribute to hepatic dysfunction and impaired detoxification capacity. This multi-system dysregulation creates the metabolic suppression, cognitive dysfunction, and energy depletion that characterizes chronic fatigue syndrome, establishing a self-reinforcing cycle where immune dysregulation perpetuates the very conditions that maintain the pathological Th1/Th2/Th17 imbalance.
