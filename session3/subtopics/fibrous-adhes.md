# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Fibrous adhesions form as a result of chronic inflammation in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Chronic inflammation in endometriosis creates a pro-fibrotic microenvironment that drives fibrous adhesion formation through multiple interconnected biochemical pathways. The persistent presence of ectopic endometrial tissue triggers sustained activation of inflammatory cascades, particularly through nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, which upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These cytokines, in conjunction with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) released from activated macrophages and damaged tissues, stimulate the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway particularly drives excessive collagen synthesis (primarily types I and III), while simultaneously promoting the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) that prevent normal extracellular matrix degradation, creating an imbalanced matrix remodeling environment conducive to fibrous tissue formation.

The formation of fibrous adhesions creates a mechanistic bridge supporting the global thesis by establishing physical and biochemical conditions that promote gastrointestinal dysfunction and subsequent SIBO development. Peritoneal adhesions, particularly those involving the bowel wall, can directly impair normal peristaltic function through physical restriction and neural pathway disruption. The chronic inflammatory milieu associated with adhesion formation also affects enteric nervous system function through the release of inflammatory mediators that interfere with normal gut motility patterns. Additionally, adhesions create areas of relative stasis and altered flow dynamics within the intestinal tract, providing favorable conditions for bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. The ongoing inflammatory response within adhesive tissue maintains elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which further compromise intestinal barrier function and perpetuate the inflammatory cycle.

The perpetuation of chronic inflammation through fibrous adhesion formation amplifies systemic inflammatory burden and contributes to the downstream disruption of neuroendocrine pathways central to the global thesis. Adhesions serve as persistent sources of inflammatory mediator release, maintaining elevated circulating levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which directly interfere with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function through suppression of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responsiveness. The chronic inflammatory state also promotes hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis, including increased production of thyroid-binding proteins that can reduce free thyroid hormone availability. Furthermore, the sustained activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to chronic inflammation from adhesions contributes to glucocorticoid resistance and altered cortisol rhythms, creating a state of immunosuppression that can perpetuate both the inflammatory cycle and the conditions favoring SIBO development, ultimately supporting the pathway toward chronic fatigue syndrome manifestation.
