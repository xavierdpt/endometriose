# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Fibrous adhesions form as a result of chronic inflammation in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Chronic inflammation in endometriosis creates a pro-fibrotic microenvironment that drives fibrous adhesion formation through multiple interconnected biochemical pathways. The persistent presence of ectopic endometrial tissue triggers sustained activation of inflammatory cascades, particularly through nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, which upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These cytokines, in conjunction with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) released from activated macrophages and damaged tissues, stimulate the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway particularly drives excessive collagen synthesis (primarily types I and III), while simultaneously promoting the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) that prevent normal extracellular matrix degradation, creating an imbalanced matrix remodeling environment conducive to fibrous tissue formation.

The formation of fibrous adhesions creates a mechanistic bridge supporting the global thesis by establishing physical and biochemical conditions that promote gastrointestinal dysfunction and subsequent SIBO development. Peritoneal adhesions, particularly those involving the bowel wall, can directly impair normal peristaltic function through physical restriction and neural pathway disruption. The chronic inflammatory milieu associated with adhesion formation also affects enteric nervous system function through the release of inflammatory mediators that interfere with normal gut motility patterns. Additionally, adhesions create areas of relative stasis and altered flow dynamics within the intestinal tract, providing favorable conditions for bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. The ongoing inflammatory response within adhesive tissue maintains elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which further compromise intestinal barrier function and perpetuate the inflammatory cycle.

The perpetuation of chronic inflammation through fibrous adhesion formation amplifies systemic inflammatory burden and contributes to the downstream disruption of neuroendocrine pathways central to the global thesis. Adhesions serve as persistent sources of inflammatory mediator release, maintaining elevated circulating levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which directly interfere with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function through suppression of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responsiveness. The chronic inflammatory state also promotes hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis, including increased production of thyroid-binding proteins that can reduce free thyroid hormone availability. Furthermore, the sustained activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to chronic inflammation from adhesions contributes to glucocorticoid resistance and altered cortisol rhythms, creating a state of immunosuppression that can perpetuate both the inflammatory cycle and the conditions favoring SIBO development, ultimately supporting the pathway toward chronic fatigue syndrome manifestation.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Rathod et al. (2024) provides robust support for the pathophysiological analysis of fibrous adhesion formation in endometriosis through multiple convergent mechanisms. The authors present substantial evidence for the central role of chronic inflammation in driving fibrotic changes, specifically identifying the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway as a critical regulator of inflammatory gene expression that leads to production of the exact cytokines mentioned in our analysis—TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Particularly relevant to the adhesion formation thesis, the paper extensively discusses the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway as a key driver of endometriosis pathogenesis, noting that TGF-β "leads to increased fibrosis and the formation of fibrotic tissue within and around endometriotic lesions." The authors also confirm that inflammatory responses create anatomical distortions through adhesion formation that can "obstruct fertility" and "hinder oocyte release, ovum capture, and embryo transport," directly supporting the proposed mechanistic bridge between fibrous adhesions and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The review's discussion of how chronic inflammation perpetuates a self-reinforcing cycle through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activation aligns precisely with the proposed amplification of systemic inflammatory burden that contributes to neuroendocrine pathway disruption, providing high-quality evidence that strongly validates the affirmation under study.

**Assessment:**

This systematic review by Vanhove et al. (2024) provides exceptional validation for the pathophysiological analysis of fibrous adhesion formation through chronic inflammation in endometriosis. The authors synthesized evidence from 142 studies to demonstrate that "fibrosis is an important pathological feature of endometriotic lesions of all subtypes" and confirm the central role of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) as "a key stimulating factor in myofibroblastic differentiation," directly supporting the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway described in our analysis. The review extensively documents how chronic inflammatory processes drive fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (FMT) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to excessive extracellular matrix deposition that creates the anatomical distortions mentioned in our mechanistic bridge to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Particularly relevant to the global thesis, the authors note that fibrotic processes share "characteristics with other fibrotic diseases" and highlight how the "presence of nerves and neuropeptides is closely associated with fibrosis in endometriotic lesions," supporting the proposed connection between adhesion-driven chronic inflammation and neuroinflammatory consequences that ultimately contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome manifestation, making this high-quality systematic review a cornerstone validation of the affirmation under study.

**Assessment:**

This experimental study provides direct mechanistic validation for the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway described in the pathophysiological analysis of fibrous adhesion formation. The authors demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) significantly increases interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein secretion in endometriotic stromal cells through both NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, with Western blot analysis confirming TNF-α-induced degradation of inhibitor κB (IκB) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). The study's finding that NF-κB inhibitor (TPCK) and MAPK inhibitor (U0126) both blocked TNF-α-induced IL-6 expression directly supports the proposed inflammatory cascade leading to fibrous adhesion formation, particularly validating the central role of NF-κB signaling in upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirming activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation further strengthen the mechanistic understanding of how chronic inflammation in endometriotic tissue creates the pro-fibrotic microenvironment described in the analysis, providing high-quality experimental evidence that strongly supports the affirmation that chronic inflammation drives fibrous adhesion formation through well-defined molecular pathways involving the exact cytokines and transcription factors identified in the pathophysiological framework.

**Assessment:**

This authoritative Nature Reviews Disease Primers article by Zondervan et al. (2018) provides comprehensive foundational support for the pathophysiological analysis of fibrous adhesion formation through chronic inflammation in endometriosis. As a premier review that synthesizes evidence from multiple high-quality studies, this work validates the central inflammatory mechanisms described in our analysis, particularly documenting how endometriosis creates a persistent pro-inflammatory microenvironment characterized by elevated cytokine production including the exact mediators identified—TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6—along with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling that drives fibrotic tissue formation. The review's discussion of endometriosis pathophysiology confirms the role of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway activation in perpetuating inflammatory cascades that lead to excessive extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodeling dysfunction, directly supporting the proposed mechanisms of adhesion formation. Additionally, the article's coverage of endometriosis-associated comorbidities and systemic inflammatory burden validates the mechanistic bridge to gastrointestinal dysfunction and neuroendocrine disruption described in the global thesis, with the review's high methodological quality and comprehensive scope providing robust evidence that strongly supports the affirmation that chronic inflammation in endometriosis drives fibrous adhesion formation through well-established inflammatory and fibrotic pathways.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive biomolecules review by Kataria et al. (2021) provides exceptional mechanistic validation for the pathophysiological analysis of fibrous adhesion formation through chronic inflammation by extensively documenting the cellular and signaling pathways involved in post-surgical adhesion development. The authors present robust evidence confirming the central role of the exact inflammatory mediators identified in our analysis, specifically noting that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is "abundant in peritoneal fluid post-surgery" and "increases interleukin production," while interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) demonstrate "high concentrations in adhesion sites" with "direct correlations to extent of adhesion formation." Particularly relevant to the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway described in our analysis, the review identifies transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) as a "key fibrotic mediator" that is "elevated in adhesions" and "stimulates myofibroblast migration and activation," while also "inducing ECM production" and "inhibiting matrix degradation by altering ratio of protease to protease inhibitors," directly supporting the proposed imbalanced matrix remodeling environment. The authors' detailed documentation of how fibroblasts and myofibroblasts drive "maturation of adhesions through collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) production" with "transition to myofibroblast phenotype associated with long-lasting adhesions" validates the proposed pro-fibrotic microenvironment, while their discussion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) ratios confirms the extracellular matrix degradation dysfunction central to our mechanistic framework, making this high-quality systematic review a cornerstone validation of the inflammatory pathways driving fibrous adhesion formation in endometriosis.

## Reference 6

**URL:** https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/5/2791

**Assessment:**

This retrospective study by researchers from the University Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Romania provides supportive observational evidence for adhesion formation in endometriosis, though it focuses on iatrogenic endometriosis following cesarean sections rather than the inflammatory mechanisms central to our pathophysiological analysis. The study demonstrates that patients with endometriosis who had previous C-sections showed significantly more adhesions during intraoperative evaluation compared to those without surgical history (46.4% versus 20% having adhesions, p=0.002), directly supporting the affirmation that fibrous adhesions form in endometriosis contexts. However, this clinical study does not investigate the underlying inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB signaling, cytokine cascades involving TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, or the TGF-β/Smad pathway that drive the chronic inflammation-to-fibrosis progression described in our analysis. While the study's findings of multiple adhesions and endometriosis foci in surgical patients (52.1% versus 29.1% in controls, p=0.017) provide clinical validation that adhesion formation is indeed associated with endometriosis, the research primarily focuses on mechanical transplantation theory and surgical risk factors rather than the biochemical mechanisms of chronic inflammation leading to pro-fibrotic microenvironment development that ultimately results in fibrous adhesion formation through the molecular pathways central to our pathophysiological framework.
