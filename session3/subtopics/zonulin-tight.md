# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Zonulin levels are elevated in endometriosis leading to tight junction disassembly

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Zonulin, a physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions, plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity through regulation of claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) proteins. In endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammation generates elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which directly stimulate zonulin release from intestinal epithelial cells. This cytokine-mediated zonulin upregulation triggers a cascade of molecular events involving MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling and subsequent activation of protein kinase C pathways, ultimately leading to phosphorylation and disassembly of tight junction proteins. The resulting increase in intestinal permeability creates a permeable barrier that allows bacterial antigens, lipopolysaccharides, and other luminal contents to translocate across the intestinal wall.

The compromised intestinal barrier function directly facilitates the pathophysiological progression from endometriosis to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). As tight junction integrity deteriorates, the normal protective mechanisms against bacterial translocation are compromised, enabling pathogenic bacteria to migrate from the colon into the normally sterile small intestine. Simultaneously, the inflammatory milieu associated with elevated zonulin levels disrupts normal gastrointestinal motility through interference with interstitial cells of Cajal and enteric nervous system function, creating the stagnant conditions necessary for bacterial proliferation. This dual mechanism of barrier dysfunction and motility impairment establishes the ideal environment for SIBO development, with subsequent amplification of bacterial endotoxin production.

The zonulin-mediated tight junction disassembly creates a self-perpetuating cycle that amplifies the systemic inflammatory burden critical to the endometriosis-chronic fatigue pathway. As bacterial endotoxins cross the compromised intestinal barrier, they activate Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells through TLR4-mediated pathways, triggering massive release of inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. These systemic cytokines further elevate zonulin levels through positive feedback mechanisms while simultaneously suppressing hypothalamic TRH release and peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion via inhibition of DIO1 deiodinase activity. The resulting metabolic suppression, combined with ongoing bacterial translocation and endotoxemia, creates the chronic inflammatory state that disrupts mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, impairs neurological function, and ultimately manifests as the debilitating fatigue characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
