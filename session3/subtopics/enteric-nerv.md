# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Inflammatory mediators from endometriotic lesions disrupt enteric nervous system function

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Endometriotic lesions serve as persistent sources of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which can significantly disrupt enteric nervous system (ENS) function through multiple interconnected mechanisms. These inflammatory cytokines directly target enteric neurons and glial cells within the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability, altered neurotransmitter synthesis, and impaired neural circuit integration. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway becomes upregulated in response to chronic inflammation, resulting in excessive PGE2 production that modulates enteric neurotransmission by altering calcium signaling cascades and cAMP-dependent pathways, ultimately compromising the coordinated peristaltic contractions essential for normal gastrointestinal motility.

The disruption of ENS function creates a cascade of gastrointestinal dysmotility that directly facilitates the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a critical component in the endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathophysiological sequence. Impaired migrating motor complexes (MMCs) and reduced intestinal transit time allow pathogenic bacteria to colonize the small intestine, where they produce endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory metabolites. The compromised enteric neuronal control also affects the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier through dysregulation of tight junction proteins, including claudin-1 and occludin, mediated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and subsequent inflammatory signaling cascades.

This ENS dysfunction and resultant SIBO establishment creates a self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle that amplifies systemic immune activation and contributes to the progression toward chronic fatigue syndrome. The bacterial translocation and endotoxemia resulting from compromised gut barrier function activate toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathways, triggering additional cytokine release and further disrupting enteric neuronal function. This pathological loop not only maintains local gastrointestinal dysfunction but also contributes to the systemic inflammatory burden that subsequently disrupts hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function, ultimately leading to the metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. The enteric nervous system disruption thus represents a pivotal mechanistic link connecting local endometriotic inflammation to systemic pathophysiological consequences.
