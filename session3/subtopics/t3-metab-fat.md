# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** T3-mediated cellular metabolism is reduced in endometriosis patients leading to fatigue

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The reduction of T3-mediated cellular metabolism in endometriosis represents a critical downstream consequence of the inflammatory cascade that fundamentally supports the global thesis linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. T3 (triiodothyronine) serves as the primary active thyroid hormone responsible for regulating cellular oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and ATP synthesis. In endometriosis patients, chronic systemic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α directly suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis through multiple mechanisms: inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis at the hypothalamic level, blunting of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the anterior pituitary, and most critically, peripheral disruption of T4-to-T3 conversion via suppression of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) enzyme activity in hepatic and peripheral tissues.

The SIBO-endometriosis pathophysiological connection further amplifies T3 metabolic dysfunction through bacterial endotoxin-mediated mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial-derived inflammatory mediators from small intestinal bacterial overgrowth activate the TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB pathway, leading to sustained production of inflammatory cytokines that directly inhibit DIO1 expression and activity. Simultaneously, these endotoxins promote the upregulation of type 3 deiodinase (DIO3), which catalyzes the conversion of T4 and T3 to inactive reverse T3 (rT3) and T2 respectively, creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite potentially normal serum TSH and T4 levels. This enzymatic disruption is compounded by inflammatory cytokine-induced alterations in thyroid hormone transport proteins and cellular uptake mechanisms, further reducing intracellular T3 availability.

At the cellular level, reduced T3 bioavailability profoundly impacts mitochondrial oxidative capacity and energy production, directly manifesting as chronic fatigue. T3 regulates the expression of key mitochondrial enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase, ATP synthase subunits, and uncoupling proteins, while also promoting mitochondrial DNA transcription and ribosomal RNA synthesis essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. When T3 signaling is compromised, cellular respiration becomes inefficient, leading to decreased ATP production, increased reactive oxygen species generation, and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. This metabolic suppression creates a self-perpetuating cycle where energy deficits impair immune function and antioxidant systems, allowing continued inflammatory processes and further thyroidal suppression, ultimately culminating in the characteristic profound fatigue experienced by endometriosis patients and supporting the mechanistic pathway to chronic fatigue syndrome outlined in the global thesis.
