# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** DIO1 type-1 deiodinase is inhibited by inflammatory mediators in endometriosis

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The inhibition of DIO1 type-1 deiodinase by inflammatory mediators represents a critical mechanistic link in the endometriosis-to-chronic fatigue pathway through disruption of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. DIO1, predominantly expressed in liver, kidney, and thyroid tissues, catalyzes the outer ring deiodination of thyroxine (T4) to the metabolically active triiodothyronine (T3), contributing approximately 80% of peripheral T3 production. In endometriosis, the chronic inflammatory milieu characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) directly suppresses DIO1 enzyme activity through multiple mechanisms including transcriptional downregulation, post-translational modifications, and substrate competition by inflammatory metabolites.

This inflammatory-mediated DIO1 inhibition creates a state of tissue-level hypothyroidism despite potentially normal circulating T4 levels, as the conversion of the relatively inactive prohormone T4 to the metabolically active T3 becomes impaired. The resulting reduction in free T3 availability at the cellular level compromises mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, reduces ATP synthesis efficiency, and impairs thermogenesis—all fundamental processes underlying metabolic energy production. When combined with the amplified systemic inflammation from potential SIBO-related endotoxemia, this DIO1 suppression becomes particularly pronounced, as lipopolysaccharide and other bacterial toxins are potent inhibitors of deiodinase activity, creating a synergistic effect that further compounds thyroid hormone dysfunction.

The downstream consequences of DIO1 inhibition extend beyond simple metabolic suppression to encompass neuroinflammatory processes that directly contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome pathophysiology. Reduced tissue T3 availability impairs the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis feedback mechanisms, potentially leading to compensatory increases in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production, which paradoxically can exacerbate inflammatory responses through TSH receptor activation on immune cells. Additionally, the metabolic suppression resulting from impaired T4-to-T3 conversion creates a cellular energy crisis that compromises the function of energy-dependent processes including neurotransmitter synthesis, synaptic transmission, and cellular repair mechanisms, ultimately manifesting as the profound fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and exercise intolerance characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. This mechanism thus represents a key pathophysiological node where endometriosis-driven inflammation translates into the metabolic and neurological manifestations of chronic fatigue.
