# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** VEGF-mediated angiogenesis is essential for endometriotic lesion survival and growth

# Pathophysiological Analysis

VEGF-mediated angiogenesis represents a critical enabling mechanism in the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. Ectopic endometrial tissue requires adequate vascularization to survive and proliferate outside the uterine cavity, making VEGF-driven neovascularization essential for lesion establishment and maintenance. The hypoxic and inflammatory microenvironment characteristic of endometriotic implants upregulates VEGF expression through HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α) activation and NF-κB-mediated transcriptional enhancement. This angiogenic response not only sustains lesion viability but also facilitates their metabolic activity and inflammatory cytokine production, directly contributing to the systemic inflammatory burden that underlies subsequent gastrointestinal dysfunction and SIBO development.

The biochemical pathways involved in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis create multiple points of intersection with inflammatory cascades that amplify systemic pathophysiology. VEGF binding to VEGFR-2 receptors activates downstream signaling through PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, promoting endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Simultaneously, this angiogenic process stimulates the release of additional pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, TNF-α, and prostaglandin E2 from both endothelial cells and infiltrating immune cells. The resulting vascular network not only provides metabolic support for lesion growth but also serves as a conduit for inflammatory mediator dissemination, facilitating the systemic spread of cytokines that can disrupt gut barrier function and promote bacterial translocation.

Furthermore, VEGF-induced angiogenesis contributes to the perpetuation of chronic inflammatory states through the establishment of structurally and functionally abnormal vasculature within endometriotic lesions. These newly formed vessels exhibit increased permeability, irregular architecture, and enhanced inflammatory cell recruitment capacity, creating persistent inflammatory foci that continuously release cytokines into systemic circulation. This ongoing inflammatory stimulus can directly impact enteric nervous system function and intestinal motility, predisposing to SIBO development while simultaneously contributing to HPA axis dysregulation through cytokine-mediated suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function. The metabolic demands of sustained angiogenesis also contribute to systemic energy depletion, representing an additional mechanism through which VEGF-driven processes support the eventual manifestation of chronic fatigue syndrome.
