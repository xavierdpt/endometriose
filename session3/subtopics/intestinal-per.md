# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Endometriosis is associated with increased intestinal permeability

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Increased intestinal permeability represents a critical mechanistic link in the pathophysiological cascade connecting endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. In endometriosis patients, chronic pelvic inflammation and the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue can disrupt normal gastrointestinal function through multiple pathways, including inflammatory mediator release (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) elevation via COX-2 upregulation, and mechanical compression from adhesions and lesions. This inflammatory milieu can compromise intestinal epithelial integrity by disrupting tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and zonulin, leading to increased paracellular permeability commonly referred to as "leaky gut syndrome."

The compromised intestinal barrier function facilitates bacterial translocation and systemic exposure to endotoxins, particularly lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. This endotoxemia activates pattern recognition receptors including TLR4 and MyD88 pathways, triggering nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling cascades that amplify systemic inflammatory responses. The resulting cytokine storm, characterized by elevated IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, creates a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that can suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function through multiple mechanisms: direct inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis, suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release, and peripheral interference with thyroid hormone metabolism via reduced type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity.

Furthermore, increased intestinal permeability can perpetuate the pathological cycle by promoting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) through altered gut motility and immune surveillance dysfunction. The chronic endotoxin exposure associated with increased permeability can lead to Kupffer cell activation in the liver, contributing to hepatic insulin resistance and further metabolic dysfunction. Additionally, bacterial metabolites and inflammatory mediators crossing the compromised intestinal barrier can influence the gut-brain axis, potentially contributing to neuroinflammation and the central fatigue mechanisms observed in chronic fatigue syndrome. This creates a self-reinforcing pathological loop where intestinal permeability both results from and contributes to the systemic inflammatory state linking endometriosis to metabolic and neuroendocrine dysfunction.
