# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Bile acid metabolism is altered in endometriosis-associated SIBO

# Pathophysiological Analysis

Bile acid metabolism represents a critical intersection point in the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway, functioning as both a consequence of and contributor to systemic inflammatory dysregulation. In healthy individuals, bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, conjugated with glycine or taurine, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the duodenum where they facilitate lipid absorption and maintain gut barrier integrity through farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. However, in endometriosis-associated SIBO, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine leads to premature deconjugation of bile salts through bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. This deconjugation occurs before bile acids reach the terminal ileum, where they would normally be reabsorbed via the enterohepatic circulation, resulting in decreased bile acid pool size, impaired fat-soluble vitamin absorption, and disrupted FXR-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling.

The altered bile acid metabolism in SIBO creates a cascade of pathophysiological consequences that amplify the inflammatory burden established by endometriosis. Deconjugated bile acids are less effective at maintaining tight junction integrity in the intestinal epithelium, contributing to increased intestinal permeability and facilitating bacterial translocation and endotoxemia. Furthermore, the disruption of normal bile acid-microbiome interactions promotes dysbiotic bacterial communities that preferentially metabolize bile acids into secondary bile acids with altered inflammatory properties. This dysregulation compromises the gut's natural anti-inflammatory mechanisms, as bile acids normally suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production through FXR-dependent pathways and maintain immune homeostasis through regulation of T-regulatory cell function.

The systemic implications of altered bile acid metabolism directly support the global thesis by creating additional inflammatory amplification that exacerbates HPA and HPT axis dysfunction. Impaired bile acid signaling reduces hepatic glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism efficiency, contributing to the metabolic dysfunction that characterizes chronic fatigue syndrome. Additionally, bile acid dysregulation affects the gut-liver-brain axis through altered tryptophan metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis, as bile acids influence microbial production of short-chain fatty acids that serve as substrates for serotonin and other neuroactive compounds. This metabolic disruption, combined with the increased inflammatory burden from compromised gut barrier function, creates a self-perpetuating cycle that sustains the chronic inflammatory state, supports thyroidal suppression through cytokine-mediated inhibition of deiodinase activity, and ultimately contributes to the neuroinflammatory processes underlying chronic fatigue syndrome symptomatology.
