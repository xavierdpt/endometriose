# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

**Affirmation under study:** Claudin and occludin proteins are degraded in endometriosis-associated leaky gut

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The degradation of claudin and occludin proteins represents a critical mechanistic link between endometriosis and systemic pathophysiological consequences outlined in our global thesis. Claudins (particularly claudin-1, -2, -4, and -5) and occludin are essential tight junction proteins that maintain intestinal epithelial barrier integrity by forming selective paracellular seals between adjacent enterocytes. In endometriosis, chronic inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 systematically upregulate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9, which directly cleave these tight junction proteins. Simultaneously, the inflammatory milieu activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) through protein kinase C (PKC) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathways, leading to phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains and subsequent contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring, mechanically disrupting tight junction complexes and promoting claudin/occludin internalization and degradation.

This tight junction protein degradation creates intestinal hyperpermeability that facilitates bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption, directly supporting the SIBO-endotoxemia pathway central to our global thesis. When claudin and occludin barriers are compromised, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria can traverse the intestinal epithelium and enter portal circulation, triggering hepatic Kupffer cell activation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. This hepatic endotoxin recognition initiates cascading inflammatory responses including increased production of acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, haptoglobin), activation of the complement system, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) into systemic circulation. The resulting chronic low-grade endotoxemia creates a state of persistent immune activation that can suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function through cytokine-mediated inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release.

The biochemical consequences of claudin/occludin degradation extend beyond simple barrier dysfunction to include disruption of nutrient absorption and metabolic homeostasis, further supporting the metabolic suppression component of our thesis. Tight junction protein loss impairs the selective permeability that normally regulates paracellular transport of ions, water, and small molecules, leading to malabsorption of essential nutrients including selenium, zinc, and B-vitamins required for optimal thyroid hormone synthesis and peripheral conversion. Additionally, the loss of claudin-2 regulation disrupts normal sodium and water transport, potentially contributing to intestinal inflammation and altered gut microbiome composition that perpetuates SIBO development. This creates a self-reinforcing pathological cycle where tight junction degradation promotes bacterial overgrowth, which in turn produces additional inflammatory mediators and bacterial toxins that further damage intestinal barrier proteins, amplifying the systemic inflammatory burden that ultimately manifests as the neuroinflammatory and metabolic consequences characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.
