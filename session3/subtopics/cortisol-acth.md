# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Cortisol and ACTH secretion patterns are altered in endometriosis patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The alteration of cortisol and ACTH secretion patterns in endometriosis patients represents a critical component in the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. In endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammation driven by ectopic endometrial tissue creates persistent elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, which directly stimulate the hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This chronic inflammatory stimulus initially leads to compensatory increases in ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary and subsequent cortisol release from the adrenal cortex. However, the sustained nature of this inflammatory burden eventually results in HPA axis dysregulation, characterized by either cortisol resistance at the tissue level or eventual adrenal exhaustion with blunted cortisol responses despite maintained or elevated ACTH levels.

The disrupted cortisol-ACTH dynamics significantly amplify the systemic inflammatory state that underlies the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway. When cortisol's anti-inflammatory capacity becomes compromised through glucocorticoid receptor desensitization or inadequate cortisol production, the normal feedback inhibition of inflammatory cytokines is lost. This creates a permissive environment for enhanced intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, facilitating the development and maintenance of SIBO. The resulting endotoxemia from gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides further stimulates hepatic Kupffer cells and systemic macrophages, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle while simultaneously suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis through cytokine-mediated inhibition of TRH and TSH release.

Furthermore, the altered cortisol patterns directly contribute to the metabolic suppression characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome by disrupting peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. Chronic inflammation-induced cortisol resistance impairs the normal cortisol-mediated regulation of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in hepatocytes, leading to reduced peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3. Simultaneously, elevated inflammatory cytokines and disrupted cortisol signaling promote increased reverse T3 (rT3) production, creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite normal TSH levels. This metabolic suppression, combined with the neuroinflammatory effects of chronic cytokine elevation and impaired cortisol-mediated neuroprotection, establishes the biochemical foundation for the fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and reduced stress resilience observed in patients progressing from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome.
