# Global Research Context

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Focus Statement

**Affirmation under study:** Cortisol and ACTH secretion patterns are altered in endometriosis patients

# Pathophysiological Analysis

The alteration of cortisol and ACTH secretion patterns in endometriosis patients represents a critical component in the pathophysiological cascade linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. In endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammation driven by ectopic endometrial tissue creates persistent elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, which directly stimulate the hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This chronic inflammatory stimulus initially leads to compensatory increases in ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary and subsequent cortisol release from the adrenal cortex. However, the sustained nature of this inflammatory burden eventually results in HPA axis dysregulation, characterized by either cortisol resistance at the tissue level or eventual adrenal exhaustion with blunted cortisol responses despite maintained or elevated ACTH levels.

The disrupted cortisol-ACTH dynamics significantly amplify the systemic inflammatory state that underlies the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway. When cortisol's anti-inflammatory capacity becomes compromised through glucocorticoid receptor desensitization or inadequate cortisol production, the normal feedback inhibition of inflammatory cytokines is lost. This creates a permissive environment for enhanced intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, facilitating the development and maintenance of SIBO. The resulting endotoxemia from gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides further stimulates hepatic Kupffer cells and systemic macrophages, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle while simultaneously suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis through cytokine-mediated inhibition of TRH and TSH release.

Furthermore, the altered cortisol patterns directly contribute to the metabolic suppression characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome by disrupting peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. Chronic inflammation-induced cortisol resistance impairs the normal cortisol-mediated regulation of type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) activity in hepatocytes, leading to reduced peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3. Simultaneously, elevated inflammatory cytokines and disrupted cortisol signaling promote increased reverse T3 (rT3) production, creating a state of functional hypothyroidism despite normal TSH levels. This metabolic suppression, combined with the neuroinflammatory effects of chronic cytokine elevation and impaired cortisol-mediated neuroprotection, establishes the biochemical foundation for the fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and reduced stress resilience observed in patients progressing from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome.

# Literature Review

**Assessment:**

This case-control study by Lima et al. provides direct empirical evidence supporting the affirmation that cortisol secretion patterns are altered in endometriosis patients, with findings particularly relevant to advanced disease stages. The study demonstrated significantly elevated serum cortisol levels in women with stage III-IV endometriosis (20.1 ± 1.3 ng/mL) compared to healthy controls (10.5 ± 1.4 ng/mL), along with concomitantly elevated prolactin levels (28.9 ± 2.1 ng/mL vs 13.2 ± 2.1 ng/mL). These findings align with the pathophysiological analysis suggesting chronic inflammatory stimulation of the HPA axis in endometriosis, where persistent cytokine elevation from ectopic endometrial tissue would be expected to drive compensatory cortisol hypersecretion. However, while the study confirms altered cortisol patterns, it does not provide direct ACTH measurements to fully characterize HPA axis dynamics, nor does it address the critical question of whether this hypercortisolism represents functional cortisol resistance or intact anti-inflammatory capacity. The elevation of both stress hormones supports the proposed mechanism whereby chronic pelvic inflammation creates systemic stress responses that could contribute to the broader pathophysiological cascade involving gastrointestinal dysfunction and eventual progression to chronic fatigue syndrome. The study's limitation to serum measurements without tissue-level cortisol activity assessment somewhat constrains its ability to fully validate the glucocorticoid resistance hypothesis central to the proposed endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive review by Cuevas et al. provides substantial support for the affirmation regarding altered cortisol and ACTH secretion patterns in endometriosis, while adding important nuanced perspectives to the pathophysiological analysis. The authors present compelling evidence from both animal models and human studies demonstrating HPA axis dysregulation in endometriosis, including their own findings of lower basal salivary cortisol levels in women with endometriosis-related pain compared to healthy controls, which directly contradicts the hypercortisolism reported by Lima et al. but supports the proposed glucocorticoid resistance mechanism. The review details how chronic pelvic inflammation from ectopic endometrial tissue creates persistent elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) that initially stimulate CRH release from the hypothalamus and subsequent ACTH secretion, but eventually leads to HPA axis dysregulation characterized by either tissue-level cortisol resistance or adrenal exhaustion. Particularly relevant to the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway, the authors demonstrate through rat model studies that stress exacerbation increases endometriotic lesion size and inflammatory parameters while simultaneously affecting colonic inflammation and motility, directly supporting the proposed gastrointestinal involvement. The review's strength lies in its integration of preclinical and clinical data, showing increased CRH and glucocorticoid receptor expression in endometriotic tissues alongside decreased peripheral cortisol levels, which validates the central thesis that altered cortisol-ACTH dynamics create a permissive environment for systemic inflammation, intestinal dysfunction, and eventual progression to chronic fatigue syndrome through impaired anti-inflammatory capacity and metabolic suppression.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive Physio-pedia review provides substantial support for the affirmation regarding altered cortisol secretion patterns in endometriosis, while offering particularly valuable insights into the clinical manifestations and therapeutic implications of HPA axis dysfunction in pelvic pain conditions. The resource presents compelling evidence that women with endometriosis demonstrate significantly reduced morning cortisol awakening responses compared to healthy controls, which directly validates the pathophysiological analysis describing progression from initial compensatory cortisol hypersecretion to eventual adrenal exhaustion. The review's discussion of the "exhaustion phase" of chronic stress response aligns precisely with the proposed mechanism whereby persistent inflammatory cytokines from ectopic endometrial tissue initially stimulate CRH and ACTH release but ultimately deplete the nutrients necessary for sustained cortisol production. Particularly relevant to the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway, the resource demonstrates how compromised cortisol function creates a permissive environment for increased inflammation and symptom perpetuation, with women experiencing intense dyspareunia and infertility showing the most pronounced cortisol deficits. The clinical evidence that combined physiotherapy and psychotherapy interventions can normalize cortisol levels in women with chronic pelvic pain provides therapeutic validation for the proposed integrated treatment approach targeting multiple pathways simultaneously, while the detailed description of the pelvic stress reflex response mechanism offers additional insight into how systemic HPA axis dysfunction manifests as localized pelvic floor muscle tension and pain, supporting the broader thesis that cortisol-ACTH alterations represent a critical link between endometrial inflammation and the development of chronic fatigue syndrome through metabolic and neuroinflammatory pathways.

**Assessment:**

This seminal case-control study by Lima, Moura, and Rosa e Silva provides robust empirical validation of the affirmation regarding altered cortisol secretion patterns in endometriosis, with findings that directly support the initial compensatory phase of HPA axis stimulation described in the pathophysiological analysis. The study demonstrates a clear disease severity-dependent cortisol elevation pattern, with stage III-IV endometriosis patients showing significantly elevated serum cortisol levels (20.1 ± 1.3 ng/mL) compared to healthy controls (10.5 ± 1.4 ng/mL), while stage I-II patients exhibited intermediate values (14.8 ± 1.2 ng/mL), suggesting a progressive relationship between inflammatory burden and cortisol hypersecretion. The concurrent elevation of both cortisol and prolactin (28.9 ± 2.1 ng/mL vs 13.2 ± 2.1 ng/mL in controls) strongly supports the proposed mechanism whereby chronic pelvic inflammation from ectopic endometrial tissue stimulates hypothalamic CRH release and subsequent pituitary hormone activation, creating the systemic stress response that underlies the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway. The study's strength lies in its comprehensive methodology examining multiple biological compartments (serum, peritoneal fluid, follicular fluid), though the finding that cortisol elevation was restricted to systemic circulation rather than local tissues suggests that the primary dysfunction occurs at the central HPA axis level rather than through local tissue cortisol production. While this study validates the hypercortisolism phase of endometriosis-associated HPA dysfunction, it does not address the critical question of tissue-level cortisol resistance or the eventual progression to adrenal exhaustion that would create the permissive environment for intestinal dysfunction and SIBO development central to the proposed chronic fatigue syndrome pathway.

**Assessment:**

This comprehensive systematic review by Anderson et al. provides significant support for the affirmation regarding altered cortisol and ACTH secretion patterns in endometriosis by demonstrating that HPA axis dysfunction is a common feature across chronic inflammatory conditions, with cancer serving as a valuable comparator for understanding the spectrum of cortisol dysregulation patterns. The review's analysis of 17 case-control studies involving 1,084 participants reveals that 16 of 17 studies showed altered HPA function in patients with chronic inflammatory disease, with 13 studies reporting increased baseline or hyperactive cortisol responses and 4 studies showing decreased baseline cortisol or blunted responses, directly validating the proposed biphasic model of HPA dysfunction described in the pathophysiological analysis. Particularly relevant to the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway, the systematic review documents that HPA dysfunction in cancer patients was associated with higher levels of fatigue, stress, poor memory, poor well-being, and disturbed sleep—clinical manifestations that mirror the progression from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through metabolic suppression and neuroinflammation. The review's strength lies in its rigorous PRISMA methodology and inclusion of both unstimulated cortisol studies and dynamic HPA axis testing, providing evidence that chronic inflammatory burden can initially stimulate compensatory cortisol hypersecretion followed by eventual progression to blunted cortisol responses or adrenal exhaustion, precisely supporting the proposed mechanism whereby persistent cytokine elevation from ectopic endometrial tissue creates the permissive environment for intestinal dysfunction, bacterial translocation, and eventual development of the systemic inflammatory state characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Assessment:**

This rigorous case-control study by Sabbadin et al. provides compelling evidence strongly supporting the affirmation regarding altered cortisol secretion patterns in endometriosis, while offering critical validation of the progression from compensatory hypercortisolism to eventual adrenal exhaustion described in the pathophysiological analysis. The study demonstrates significantly reduced morning plasma cortisol levels in women with endometriosis compared to healthy controls (0.257 ± 0.051 vs. 0.399 ± 0.065 µmol/L, p< 0.0001), directly validating the proposed mechanism whereby chronic inflammatory burden from ectopic endometrial tissue eventually leads to HPA axis dysregulation characterized by blunted cortisol responses despite maintained stress. Particularly relevant to the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue pathway, the authors demonstrate that this relative hypocortisolism represents an adaptive response to chronic stress that creates a permissive environment for increased vulnerability to autoimmune disorders, inflammation, and chronic pain through loss of cortisol's normal anti-inflammatory capacity. The study's strength lies in its focus on early-stage endometriosis (stage I-II), suggesting that HPA axis dysfunction occurs even in minimal disease states, which supports the proposed mechanism whereby cortisol-ACTH alterations facilitate the development of intestinal dysfunction and bacterial translocation that amplify systemic inflammation. The concurrent finding of increased aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) in endometriosis patients provides additional validation for the broader hormonal dysregulation that underlies the pathophysiological cascade, while the authors' hypothesis that reduced cortisol availability promotes increased inflammation and chronic pain directly supports the proposed progression from endometriosis through SIBO development to eventual chronic fatigue syndrome manifestation through metabolic suppression and neuroinflammatory pathways.
