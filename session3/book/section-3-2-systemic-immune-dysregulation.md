# 3.2 Systemic Immune Dysregulation

## Shift from Th1 to Th2/Th17 Dominance

The immune system in healthy individuals maintains a delicate balance between different T helper cell subsets that coordinate appropriate responses to various types of threats, with Th1 cells mediating cellular immunity against intracellular pathogens, Th2 cells coordinating responses to extracellular parasites and allergens, and Th17 cells providing antimicrobial immunity at mucosal surfaces. In endometriosis complicated by SIBO, this balance becomes severely disrupted, leading to a pathological dominance of Th2 and Th17 responses that contributes to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction.

The Th1 immune response, characterized by the production of interferon-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, normally provides effective cellular immunity through the activation of macrophages, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. This response is essential for controlling intracellular pathogens and maintaining immune surveillance against abnormal cells. However, in endometriosis-associated SIBO, the chronic inflammatory environment and altered cytokine milieu suppress Th1 differentiation and function, leading to impaired cellular immunity and reduced capacity to control bacterial infections and abnormal tissue growth.

Th2 cell dominance develops through the sustained production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which create positive feedback loops that promote further Th2 differentiation while suppressing Th1 responses. The inflammatory environment in endometriosis, particularly the presence of prostaglandin E2 and other lipid mediators, favors Th2 polarization through effects on dendritic cell function and antigen presentation. This Th2 dominance contributes to allergic-type inflammatory responses, increased IgE production, and the recruitment of eosinophils and mast cells that can exacerbate tissue inflammation and damage.

Th17 cell expansion occurs in response to inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-23, which are produced in abundance during SIBO-associated inflammation. Th17 cells produce IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22, which promote neutrophil recruitment, antimicrobial peptide production, and barrier function maintenance at mucosal surfaces. While Th17 responses can provide beneficial antimicrobial immunity, excessive Th17 activation contributes to tissue inflammation, autoimmunity, and barrier dysfunction that can worsen the underlying pathological processes.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this immune shift involve alterations in the transcription factor networks that control T helper cell differentiation. T-bet, the master regulator of Th1 differentiation, becomes downregulated in the inflammatory environment of endometriosis, while GATA3 (Th2 master regulator) and RORγt (Th17 master regulator) become upregulated. These transcriptional changes are mediated by inflammatory cytokines, altered antigen presentation, and epigenetic modifications that stabilize the pathological immune polarization and make it resistant to correction.

## T-bet/GATA3/RORγt Transcription Factor Imbalance

The differentiation and functional polarization of CD4+ T helper cells is controlled by master transcription factors that coordinate the expression of lineage-specific genes and suppress alternative developmental programs. The balance between T-bet (Th1), GATA3 (Th2), and RORγt (Th17) determines the overall character of adaptive immune responses and becomes severely disrupted in endometriosis-associated SIBO, leading to pathological immune skewing that perpetuates inflammation and tissue dysfunction.

T-bet (T-box expressed in T cells) serves as the master regulator of Th1 cell differentiation and is responsible for activating the transcriptional program that leads to interferon-γ production and cellular immunity. T-bet expression is induced by STAT1 and STAT4 signaling downstream of IL-12 and interferon-γ receptors, creating positive feedback loops that stabilize Th1 differentiation. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, T-bet expression becomes suppressed through multiple mechanisms including direct cytokine inhibition, altered STAT signaling, and epigenetic silencing that prevents effective Th1 responses.

GATA3 (GATA binding protein 3) controls Th2 cell differentiation and is responsible for the coordinate expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 that characterize Th2 responses. GATA3 expression is induced by STAT6 signaling downstream of IL-4 receptors and is maintained through autocrine IL-4 production that creates self-reinforcing Th2 polarization. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, GATA3 becomes aberrantly upregulated through inflammatory mediator effects and altered cytokine environments, leading to excessive Th2 responses that contribute to allergic-type inflammation and tissue eosinophilia.

RORγt (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t) serves as the master regulator of Th17 cell differentiation and coordinates the expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, and other Th17-associated cytokines. RORγt expression is induced by STAT3 signaling downstream of IL-6 and IL-23 receptors, with TGF-β providing additional differentiation signals. The inflammatory environment in SIBO provides abundant IL-6 and TGF-β that drive RORγt expression and Th17 differentiation, leading to excessive IL-17 production that contributes to neutrophilic inflammation and tissue damage.

The mutual antagonism between these transcription factors normally prevents inappropriate co-expression and maintains stable T helper cell phenotypes. T-bet can directly suppress GATA3 and RORγt expression, while GATA3 inhibits T-bet and RORγt function. However, in chronic inflammatory conditions like endometriosis-associated SIBO, these normal regulatory mechanisms become disrupted, leading to unstable T cell phenotypes and the emergence of pathological T cell subsets that express multiple master regulators simultaneously.

Epigenetic regulation of these transcription factors involves DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling that can create stable or reversible changes in gene expression patterns. Chronic inflammation can induce epigenetic changes that favor GATA3 and RORγt expression while suppressing T-bet, creating heritable changes in immune function that persist even after the initial inflammatory stimuli are removed. These epigenetic modifications represent important mechanisms for the long-term immune dysfunction observed in endometriosis patients.

## Foxp3 Regulatory T Cell Suppression

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing the transcription factor Foxp3 represent a critical immune regulatory population that maintains immune homeostasis by suppressing excessive inflammatory responses and preventing autoimmunity. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, Foxp3+ Treg function becomes significantly impaired through multiple mechanisms involving altered development, reduced suppressive capacity, and functional reprogramming that contributes to uncontrolled inflammation and immune dysfunction.

Foxp3 expression defines the regulatory T cell lineage and is essential for the development and maintenance of suppressive function. Foxp3 acts as a master regulator that coordinates the expression of numerous genes involved in immune suppression while simultaneously repressing genes associated with effector T cell function. The stability of Foxp3 expression is maintained through complex regulatory networks involving DNA methylation, histone modifications, and transcriptional feedback loops that can become disrupted in inflammatory environments.

Natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) develop in the thymus through interactions with self-antigens and represent a stable population with potent suppressive capacity. However, in endometriosis-associated inflammation, nTreg development can be impaired through effects on thymic function and antigen presentation, leading to reduced numbers of circulating Tregs with compromised suppressive ability. The inflammatory cytokines present in endometriosis, particularly TNF-α and IL-6, can directly interfere with Foxp3 expression and Treg development.

Induced regulatory T cells (iTregs) can develop in peripheral tissues from conventional CD4+ T cells in response to TGF-β and other regulatory signals. While iTreg induction might theoretically compensate for impaired nTreg function, the inflammatory environment in endometriosis-associated SIBO often prevents effective iTreg development through inflammatory cytokine interference with TGF-β signaling. Additionally, the iTregs that do develop may have reduced stability and suppressive capacity compared to natural Tregs.

The suppressive mechanisms employed by functional Tregs include direct cell-contact inhibition, suppressive cytokine production (IL-10, TGF-β, IL-35), metabolic disruption of effector T cells, and modulation of antigen-presenting cell function. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, these suppressive mechanisms become impaired through inflammatory mediator effects on Treg function, altered expression of suppressive molecules, and resistance of effector T cells to regulatory signals. The loss of effective immune regulation contributes to sustained inflammatory activation and tissue damage.

Treg plasticity represents an additional concern in chronic inflammatory conditions, as regulatory T cells can lose Foxp3 expression and acquire effector functions under certain inflammatory conditions. The cytokine environment in endometriosis-associated SIBO, particularly the presence of IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators, can promote Treg instability and conversion to pathogenic effector T cells that contribute to inflammation rather than suppressing it. This loss of regulatory function and gain of pathogenic activity represents a critical mechanism of immune dysregulation.

## IL-10 Signaling Disruption

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) serves as one of the most important anti-inflammatory cytokines in the immune system and plays crucial roles in limiting inflammatory responses, promoting tissue repair, and maintaining immune homeostasis. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, IL-10 signaling becomes significantly disrupted through alterations in cytokine production, receptor expression, and downstream signaling pathways, contributing to uncontrolled inflammation and impaired resolution of inflammatory responses.

IL-10 production occurs through multiple immune cell types including regulatory T cells, alternatively activated macrophages, B cells, and certain dendritic cell subsets. The regulation of IL-10 production involves complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that respond to inflammatory stimuli while providing negative feedback to limit excessive inflammation. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, IL-10 production becomes dysregulated through altered cellular differentiation, impaired transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional modifications that reduce anti-inflammatory capacity.

The IL-10 receptor complex consists of IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 subunits that form heterodimeric receptors on target cells and mediate IL-10 signaling through JAK1 and TYK2 kinases. IL-10 binding induces receptor dimerization and JAK activation, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and the transcriptional activation of anti-inflammatory genes. In chronic inflammatory conditions like endometriosis-associated SIBO, IL-10 receptor expression can become downregulated, reducing cellular responsiveness to anti-inflammatory signals and preventing effective inflammation resolution.

STAT3 signaling downstream of IL-10 receptors activates transcriptional programs that suppress inflammatory gene expression and promote anti-inflammatory responses. IL-10-activated STAT3 induces the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins that inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, in endometriosis-associated inflammation, STAT3 signaling can become dysregulated through inflammatory mediator effects and altered kinase/phosphatase balance.

The anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 include suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inhibition of antigen presentation, promotion of regulatory immune cell development, and enhancement of tissue repair processes. IL-10 can directly inhibit the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and other inflammatory mediators while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory molecules and tissue repair factors. The loss of effective IL-10 signaling in endometriosis-associated SIBO prevents these beneficial effects and allows inflammatory responses to persist unchecked.

Negative regulation of IL-10 signaling involves multiple mechanisms including receptor internalization, phosphatase-mediated STAT3 dephosphorylation, and SOCS-mediated inhibition of JAK kinases. In chronic inflammatory conditions, these negative regulatory mechanisms may become overactive, leading to reduced IL-10 responsiveness even when IL-10 production remains adequate. The balance between IL-10 signaling activation and inhibition determines the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory responses and can become pathologically altered in endometriosis-associated immune dysfunction.

## NK Cell Cytotoxicity Impairment

Natural killer (NK) cells represent a critical component of innate immunity that provides immune surveillance against infected cells, tumor cells, and other abnormal targets through sophisticated recognition mechanisms and potent cytotoxic effector functions. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, NK cell function becomes significantly impaired through alterations in cell development, activation, and cytotoxic capacity, contributing to reduced immune surveillance and increased susceptibility to infections and malignant transformation.

NK cell activation is controlled by the balance between activating and inhibitory receptors that recognize specific ligands on target cells and determine whether cytotoxic responses are initiated. Activating receptors including NKG2D, DNAM-1, and various natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) recognize stress-induced ligands and pathogen-associated molecules, while inhibitory receptors including KIRs and NKG2A recognize MHC class I molecules and provide self-tolerance signals. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, this delicate balance becomes disrupted through altered receptor expression and ligand availability.

The cytotoxic mechanisms employed by NK cells include the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes, death receptor-mediated apoptosis through TRAIL and FasL, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Perforin creates pores in target cell membranes that allow granzyme entry and subsequent target cell apoptosis, while death receptor pathways activate caspase cascades that lead to programmed cell death. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, these cytotoxic mechanisms become impaired through altered granule content, reduced degranulation capacity, and impaired death receptor signaling.

NK cell development and maturation occur through complex processes involving interactions with stromal cells, cytokine signaling, and educational processes that determine functional capacity. The inflammatory environment in endometriosis can affect NK cell development through altered cytokine availability, particularly reductions in IL-15 and other factors essential for NK cell survival and function. Additionally, chronic inflammatory activation can lead to NK cell exhaustion and functional impairment similar to that observed in chronic viral infections and cancer.

The phenotypic characteristics of NK cells become altered in endometriosis-associated inflammation, with shifts toward less mature and functionally impaired subsets. Mature NK cells normally express high levels of cytotoxic molecules and activating receptors while maintaining appropriate inhibitory receptor expression, but inflammatory conditions can disrupt this maturation process and lead to the accumulation of dysfunctional NK cell populations with reduced cytotoxic capacity.

NK cell trafficking and tissue distribution become altered in endometriosis-associated inflammation through changes in chemokine receptor expression and adhesion molecule function. NK cells normally circulate through blood and lymphoid organs while maintaining the capacity to rapidly migrate to sites of infection or tissue damage. However, chronic inflammation can trap NK cells in inflammatory tissues or prevent their effective recruitment to sites where they are needed, contributing to localized immune surveillance defects and systemic immune dysfunction.

## Perforin/Granzyme Pathway Dysfunction

The perforin/granzyme cytotoxic pathway represents the primary mechanism by which NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate abnormal target cells and provides essential immune surveillance against infections and malignancies. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, this critical cytotoxic mechanism becomes significantly impaired through alterations in granule biogenesis, protein expression, and degranulation processes that compromise the ability to eliminate dangerous cells effectively.

Perforin serves as the primary pore-forming protein that enables granzyme entry into target cells and is essential for effective cytotoxic function. Perforin is stored in specialized cytotoxic granules along with granzymes and other effector molecules, and is released through directed degranulation following target cell recognition. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, perforin expression and function can become impaired through inflammatory mediator effects on gene expression, protein stability, and granule formation processes.

Granzymes represent a family of serine proteases that induce target cell apoptosis through multiple pathways involving caspase activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA fragmentation. Granzyme B, the most abundant and well-studied family member, can directly activate caspase-3 and other execution caspases while also inducing mitochondrial cytochrome c release through Bid cleavage. In chronic inflammatory conditions like endometriosis-associated SIBO, granzyme expression and enzymatic activity can become reduced through inflammatory mediator effects and oxidative damage.

Cytotoxic granule biogenesis involves complex cellular processes that coordinate the synthesis, packaging, and storage of cytotoxic effector molecules in specialized organelles that can be rapidly mobilized for target cell killing. The formation of functional cytotoxic granules requires appropriate protein targeting, granule maturation, and maintenance of optimal granule content. Inflammatory conditions can disrupt these processes through effects on protein trafficking, organelle biogenesis, and cellular metabolism.

The degranulation process involves the directed release of cytotoxic granule contents at the immunological synapse formed between cytotoxic effector cells and their targets. This process requires precise coordination of granule trafficking, membrane fusion, and content release that enables selective target cell killing while protecting the effector cell from self-damage. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, degranulation can become impaired through alterations in calcium signaling, cytoskeletal function, and membrane trafficking processes.

Alternative cytotoxic pathways involving death receptors (TRAIL, FasL) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) may partially compensate for perforin/granzyme dysfunction but are often insufficient to maintain effective immune surveillance. These alternative pathways can also become impaired in chronic inflammatory conditions through alterations in receptor expression, antibody production, and signal transduction. The cumulative impairment of multiple cytotoxic mechanisms creates profound immune surveillance defects that increase susceptibility to infections and malignancies.

## CD4+ T Cell Differentiation Cascade Alterations

The differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into functionally distinct effector and regulatory subsets represents a fundamental process in adaptive immunity that determines the character and effectiveness of immune responses. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, this differentiation process becomes severely disrupted through alterations in antigen presentation, cytokine environments, and transcriptional regulation that lead to the development of pathological T cell populations with inappropriate functional characteristics.

Naive CD4+ T cells undergo initial activation through interactions with antigen-presenting cells that provide both antigen recognition signals through the T cell receptor and costimulatory signals through CD28 and other accessory molecules. The strength and duration of these initial signals, along with the cytokine environment present during activation, determine the subsequent differentiation pathway and functional characteristics of the resulting effector cells. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, altered antigen presentation and inflammatory cytokine production skew this initial activation process toward pathological outcomes.

The cytokine environment during T cell activation serves as the primary determinant of differentiation fate, with specific cytokine combinations promoting distinct T helper cell lineages. IL-12 and interferon-γ promote Th1 differentiation, IL-4 drives Th2 development, TGF-β and IL-6 induce Th17 differentiation, while TGF-β alone promotes regulatory T cell development. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, the altered cytokine milieu favors Th2 and Th17 differentiation while suppressing Th1 and regulatory T cell development, leading to inappropriate immune polarization.

Transcriptional networks that control T cell differentiation involve complex interactions between lineage-specifying transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes, and epigenetic modifications that establish stable gene expression programs. The initial cytokine signals activate STAT transcription factors that induce the expression of master regulators, which then coordinate the activation of lineage-specific genes while suppressing alternative developmental programs. In chronic inflammatory conditions, these transcriptional networks can become dysregulated through sustained inflammatory signaling and epigenetic alterations.

Memory T cell development represents an important component of adaptive immunity that provides enhanced responses to previously encountered antigens. The differentiation of effector T cells into memory populations involves complex processes that determine whether cells become central memory, effector memory, or tissue-resident memory T cells with distinct functional characteristics and tissue distribution patterns. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, memory T cell development can become skewed toward pathological populations that maintain chronic inflammatory activation.

Plasticity of T helper cell lineages allows for functional reprogramming in response to changing environmental conditions but can become pathological in chronic inflammatory diseases. Th17 cells can lose IL-17 production and acquire Th1-like characteristics, while regulatory T cells can lose suppressive function and gain effector capabilities. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, this plasticity often leads to the development of pathogenic T cell populations that contribute to inflammation rather than resolving it, representing a critical mechanism of immune dysfunction.

## Immune Tolerance Breakdown

Immune tolerance represents a fundamental property of the immune system that prevents inappropriate responses to self-antigens and maintains peaceful coexistence with beneficial commensal microorganisms. In endometriosis-associated SIBO, multiple tolerance mechanisms become disrupted, leading to autoimmune responses, loss of microbial tolerance, and the development of pathological immune activation against normally harmless antigens.

Central tolerance mechanisms that eliminate or inactivate self-reactive lymphocytes during development in primary lymphoid organs provide the foundation for self-tolerance but can become impaired in chronic inflammatory conditions. Thymic selection processes that eliminate dangerous T cells while preserving useful ones can be affected by inflammatory mediators and altered antigen presentation, leading to the escape of potentially autoreactive T cells into the periphery. Similarly, B cell tolerance mechanisms in the bone marrow can become disrupted, allowing the development of autoantibody-producing B cells.

Peripheral tolerance mechanisms that control immune responses in secondary lymphoid organs and tissues become particularly important when central tolerance is incomplete or when new antigens are encountered. These mechanisms include regulatory T cell-mediated suppression, anergy induction in self-reactive lymphocytes, and deletion of activated cells through apoptosis. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, peripheral tolerance mechanisms become overwhelmed or dysfunctional, allowing inappropriate immune activation and autoimmune responses.

Molecular mimicry represents an important mechanism by which infections can trigger autoimmune responses through cross-reactivity between microbial and self-antigens. In SIBO-associated endometriosis, the increased bacterial load and altered bacterial composition create enhanced opportunities for molecular mimicry, while the compromised tolerance mechanisms fail to prevent inappropriate cross-reactive responses. This can lead to the development of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells that target endometrial and other tissues.

Bystander activation occurs when innocent cells become targets of immune responses due to their presence in inflammatory environments, even without specific antigen recognition. The chronic inflammation associated with endometriosis and SIBO creates environments where bystander activation can occur, leading to tissue damage and the release of new self-antigens that can perpetuate autoimmune responses. This mechanism contributes to the progressive nature of autoimmune tissue damage in endometriosis.

Epitope spreading represents the expansion of immune responses to include additional antigens beyond the initial target, occurring when tissue damage releases new antigens that become targets for immune recognition. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, epitope spreading can lead to the progressive expansion of autoimmune responses to include multiple endometrial and other tissue antigens, contributing to disease progression and the development of systemic autoimmune manifestations.

## Autoimmune Response Development

The development of autoimmune responses in endometriosis-associated SIBO represents a critical transition from local inflammatory disease to systemic autoimmune pathology that can affect multiple organ systems and create persistent immune dysfunction. This autoimmune development involves the breakdown of tolerance mechanisms, the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, and the production of pathogenic autoantibodies that target self-tissues.

Autoantibody production represents one of the most clinically apparent manifestations of autoimmune development in endometriosis patients. Autoantibodies targeting various endometrial antigens, including anti-endometrial antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, and anti-nuclear antibodies, can develop through molecular mimicry, bystander activation, and epitope spreading mechanisms. These autoantibodies can contribute to tissue damage, interfere with normal physiological processes, and serve as biomarkers for autoimmune activity.

Autoreactive T cell activation represents another critical component of autoimmune development that can mediate direct tissue damage through cellular cytotoxicity and coordinate broader immune responses through cytokine production and immune cell activation. Autoreactive CD4+ T cells can promote autoantibody production, activate macrophages for tissue destruction, and recruit additional inflammatory cells to target tissues. Autoreactive CD8+ T cells can directly kill target cells expressing self-antigens and contribute to tissue destruction.

The target antigens involved in endometriosis-associated autoimmunity include various endometrial proteins, hormonal receptors, and cellular components that become exposed or modified during inflammatory tissue damage. Heat shock proteins, which are upregulated during cellular stress, represent common targets for autoimmune responses and can trigger cross-reactive responses against normal cellular proteins. Additionally, post-translational modifications of proteins during inflammation can create neo-antigens that become targets for autoimmune recognition.

Antigen presentation mechanisms become altered in autoimmune conditions through changes in MHC molecule expression, altered peptide processing, and modified antigen-presenting cell function. Professional antigen-presenting cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells can present self-antigens in inflammatory contexts that promote autoreactive T cell activation rather than tolerance induction. The inflammatory environment provides costimulatory signals that overcome normal tolerance mechanisms and promote autoimmune activation.

The tissue distribution and organ specificity of autoimmune responses in endometriosis can extend beyond reproductive organs to include other systems affected by molecular mimicry and cross-reactive responses. Autoimmune thyroid disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune conditions occur with increased frequency in endometriosis patients, suggesting common mechanisms and shared susceptibility factors. The systemic nature of autoimmune development reflects the breakdown of fundamental tolerance mechanisms that normally prevent inappropriate immune activation.

## Immune Cell Exhaustion and Dysfunction

Chronic immune activation in endometriosis-associated SIBO leads to progressive immune cell exhaustion and dysfunction that impairs the ability to mount effective responses to new challenges while maintaining persistent low-level inflammatory activation. This exhaustion phenotype affects multiple immune cell types and represents a maladaptive response to sustained antigenic stimulation that can have profound consequences for immune function and disease progression.

T cell exhaustion represents a well-characterized phenomenon that occurs during chronic infections and cancer, characterized by progressive loss of effector functions, altered transcriptional programs, and expression of inhibitory receptors including PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3. In endometriosis-associated inflammation, similar exhaustion patterns develop in response to chronic antigenic stimulation and inflammatory activation. Exhausted T cells show reduced proliferative capacity, impaired cytokine production, and altered metabolic programming that limits their effectiveness.

The molecular mechanisms of T cell exhaustion involve complex transcriptional and epigenetic changes that progressively restrict cellular function and responsiveness. The transcription factors TOX and EOMES become upregulated in exhausted T cells and coordinate the expression of inhibitory receptors while suppressing effector functions. These transcriptional changes can become epigenetically fixed through DNA methylation and histone modifications, making exhaustion difficult to reverse even when inflammatory stimuli are removed.

NK cell exhaustion occurs through similar mechanisms involving sustained activation, altered receptor expression, and metabolic dysfunction that reduces cytotoxic capacity and immune surveillance function. Exhausted NK cells show reduced granule content, impaired degranulation, and altered cytokine production that limits their ability to eliminate abnormal cells. The loss of NK cell function contributes to increased susceptibility to infections and potential malignant transformation.

B cell dysfunction in chronic inflammatory conditions includes altered antibody production, impaired memory responses, and the development of regulatory B cell populations that can suppress immune responses. While some B cell responses may become hyperactivated leading to autoantibody production, overall B cell function often becomes impaired through exhaustion mechanisms similar to those affecting T cells. This dysfunction affects both humoral immunity and B cell antigen presentation functions.

Metabolic dysfunction represents a critical component of immune cell exhaustion that affects cellular energy production, biosynthetic capacity, and signaling pathways. Exhausted immune cells show altered glucose metabolism, reduced mitochondrial function, and impaired amino acid metabolism that limits their functional capacity. The inflammatory environment in endometriosis-associated SIBO creates metabolic stress that contributes to immune cell dysfunction and exhaustion development.

Recovery from immune exhaustion represents a significant challenge that may require both removal of inflammatory stimuli and active interventions to restore normal immune function. Checkpoint inhibitor therapies that block inhibitory receptors can partially reverse T cell exhaustion, while metabolic interventions may help restore cellular energy metabolism. However, the complex nature of exhaustion and the multiple cell types affected make complete functional recovery difficult to achieve in chronic inflammatory conditions.
