# 4.1 HPA Axis Dysregulation

## 4.1.1 Chronic Inflammation Effects on Hypothalamic Function

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis represents one of the most important neuroendocrine systems responsible for coordinating physiological responses to stress and maintaining homeostasis through the regulated production of glucocorticoid hormones. In endometriosis complicated by SIBO and chronic systemic inflammation, the normal functioning of this critical axis becomes severely disrupted through multiple mechanisms that affect hypothalamic regulation, pituitary responsiveness, and adrenal function, leading to profound alterations in stress response capacity and metabolic regulation.

The hypothalamus serves as the central integrator of stress signals and inflammatory inputs that determine the activation of the HPA axis through the production and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from paraventricular nucleus neurons. Under normal conditions, various stressors including physical stress, psychological stress, and inflammatory mediators stimulate CRH release, which then travels through the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system to activate anterior pituitary corticotroph cells. However, in chronic inflammatory conditions like endometriosis-associated SIBO, this finely tuned regulatory system becomes dysregulated through sustained inflammatory activation.

Inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), exert profound effects on hypothalamic function by directly stimulating CRH neurons and altering the sensitivity of the HPA axis to stress signals. These cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier through active transport mechanisms or act on circumventricular organs where the blood-brain barrier is incomplete, enabling direct communication between peripheral inflammatory processes and central neuroendocrine regulation. The chronic elevation of these inflammatory mediators in endometriosis creates sustained stimulation of hypothalamic CRH neurons.

The molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators affect hypothalamic function involve activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and other transcriptional pathways that alter CRH gene expression and neuronal excitability. IL-1β can directly activate NF-κB in CRH neurons, leading to increased CRH gene transcription and enhanced neuronal sensitivity to stress signals. Additionally, inflammatory mediators can affect the expression and function of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels that regulate CRH neuronal activity, creating complex alterations in hypothalamic responsiveness.

Chronic inflammation also affects the normal circadian regulation of the HPA axis by disrupting the molecular clock mechanisms that control the timing of CRH release and HPA axis activity. The inflammatory cytokines can interfere with clock gene expression in hypothalamic neurons and alter the normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol production. This disruption of circadian HPA axis function contributes to the sleep disturbances, fatigue, and metabolic dysfunction commonly observed in endometriosis patients with significant inflammatory involvement.

The neuroanatomical changes that occur in chronic inflammation include microglial activation, astrocytic proliferation, and alterations in synaptic connectivity within hypothalamic circuits that regulate HPA axis function. Activated microglia can produce inflammatory mediators locally within the brain, creating a neuroinflammatory environment that perpetuates HPA axis dysfunction even when peripheral inflammation is controlled. These structural and functional changes in hypothalamic circuits can create long-lasting alterations in stress responsiveness that persist even after the resolution of acute inflammatory episodes.

## 4.1.2 CRH Gene Expression Modulation and Transcriptional Control

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene expression represents the primary control point for HPA axis activation and is subject to complex transcriptional regulation that integrates multiple stress and inflammatory signals to determine the magnitude and duration of HPA axis responses. In endometriosis-associated chronic inflammation, the normal transcriptional control mechanisms become altered, leading to inappropriate CRH expression patterns that contribute to HPA axis dysregulation and altered stress responsiveness.

The CRH gene promoter contains multiple regulatory elements that respond to different classes of stimuli, including stress-responsive elements, inflammatory cytokine response elements, and circadian regulatory sequences that enable precise temporal and stimulus-specific control of CRH expression. The cAMP response element (CRE) represents one of the most important regulatory sequences and mediates CRH induction in response to stress signals through protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. However, inflammatory mediators can alter CREB phosphorylation and function, leading to dysregulated CRH expression.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) binding sites within the CRH promoter enable direct transcriptional activation by inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β and TNF-α, creating a molecular link between peripheral inflammation and central HPA axis activation. The activation of NF-κB in hypothalamic CRH neurons leads to increased CRH gene transcription and can create sustained elevation of CRH expression when inflammatory stimuli persist. This inflammatory activation of CRH transcription bypasses normal stress-response pathways and can lead to inappropriate HPA axis activation.

Glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the CRH promoter normally provide negative feedback regulation by enabling cortisol to suppress its own synthesis through inhibition of CRH gene expression. This negative feedback mechanism is essential for limiting the duration and magnitude of HPA axis responses and preventing excessive glucocorticoid exposure. However, in chronic inflammatory conditions, this negative feedback can become impaired through inflammatory interference with glucocorticoid receptor function, leading to loss of normal HPA axis regulation.

Epigenetic modifications of the CRH gene, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, can create stable alterations in CRH expression that persist beyond the duration of initial inflammatory stimuli. Chronic inflammation can induce changes in DNA methyltransferases, histone-modifying enzymes, and chromatin structure that alter CRH gene accessibility and transcriptional responsiveness. These epigenetic changes can create long-lasting alterations in HPA axis function that contribute to the chronic nature of stress-related symptoms in endometriosis patients.

The post-transcriptional regulation of CRH involves microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins that affect CRH mRNA stability, translation, and subcellular localization. Inflammatory mediators can alter the expression of specific microRNAs that target CRH mRNA, leading to changes in CRH protein production that may not be reflected in gene transcription levels. Additionally, stress and inflammation can affect the processing and maturation of CRH precursor peptides, influencing the bioactive CRH available for release.

## 4.1.3 ACTH Receptor Signaling and Pituitary Responsiveness

The anterior pituitary corticotroph cells that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) represent the intermediate component of the HPA axis and serve as the critical link between hypothalamic CRH release and adrenal cortisol production. In endometriosis-associated chronic inflammation, the function of these cells becomes altered through changes in CRH receptor expression, intracellular signaling pathways, and ACTH synthesis and release mechanisms that contribute to inappropriate HPA axis activation and altered stress responsiveness.

CRH receptors on pituitary corticotroph cells belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family and signal primarily through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway to stimulate ACTH synthesis and release. CRH binding to its receptor activates adenylyl cyclase through Gs protein coupling, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates CREB and other transcription factors that regulate pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression, the precursor protein from which ACTH is derived.

The regulation of CRH receptor expression and function becomes altered in chronic inflammatory conditions through direct effects of inflammatory cytokines on pituitary cells and indirect effects mediated through altered hypothalamic input patterns. IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 can directly affect pituitary corticotroph cells by altering CRH receptor expression, modifying receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase, and affecting the sensitivity of the cAMP signaling pathway. These changes can lead to enhanced pituitary responsiveness to CRH and inappropriate ACTH release.

POMC gene expression in pituitary corticotroph cells is regulated by multiple transcriptional pathways that integrate CRH signaling with other regulatory inputs including negative feedback from glucocorticoids. The POMC promoter contains multiple regulatory elements including CRE sequences that respond to PKA signaling, glucocorticoid response elements that mediate negative feedback, and other regulatory sequences that respond to various hormonal and inflammatory signals. Chronic inflammation can alter the balance between these regulatory inputs and lead to dysregulated ACTH production.

The processing of POMC to generate mature ACTH involves complex enzymatic cleavage processes that occur within specialized secretory granules in corticotroph cells. The enzymes responsible for POMC processing, including prohormone convertases, can be affected by inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress, potentially altering the efficiency of ACTH generation and the relative production of other POMC-derived peptides including β-endorphin. These processing alterations can affect both the quantity and quality of ACTH released in response to stress signals.

Vasopressin (AVP) serves as an important co-secretagogue with CRH for ACTH release and can significantly amplify pituitary responses to stress stimuli. AVP is released from hypothalamic neurons in response to stress and inflammation and acts through V1b receptors on corticotroph cells to enhance ACTH release synergistically with CRH. In chronic inflammatory conditions, AVP release patterns can become altered, contributing to inappropriate ACTH secretion and loss of normal HPA axis regulation.

## 4.1.4 Cortisol Biosynthesis and 11β-Hydroxylase Regulation

Cortisol biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex represents the final step in HPA axis activation and involves complex enzymatic pathways that convert cholesterol to cortisol through multiple intermediates. The regulation of these biosynthetic pathways becomes altered in chronic inflammatory conditions like endometriosis-associated SIBO, leading to changes in cortisol production capacity, altered steroid hormone balance, and disrupted diurnal cortisol rhythm that contribute to metabolic dysfunction and impaired stress responsiveness.

The steroidogenic pathway that leads to cortisol production begins with the transport of cholesterol into mitochondria through the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which represents the rate-limiting step in steroid hormone synthesis. ACTH stimulation increases StAR expression and activity through cAMP-dependent mechanisms, enabling increased cholesterol delivery to the first enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1). Chronic ACTH stimulation can lead to adaptive changes in StAR expression and cholesterol metabolism that affect cortisol production capacity.

11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) catalyzes the final step in cortisol biosynthesis by converting 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and represents a critical control point for cortisol production. The expression and activity of 11β-hydroxylase are regulated by ACTH through cAMP-dependent transcriptional mechanisms and can be affected by inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress, and other factors that influence adrenal function. Chronic inflammation can lead to alterations in 11β-hydroxylase expression that affect cortisol production capacity and contribute to HPA axis dysfunction.

The enzymatic activity of 11β-hydroxylase requires molecular oxygen and electrons provided by NADPH through the electron transport chain involving adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin. Oxidative stress associated with chronic inflammation can impair this electron transport system and reduce 11β-hydroxylase activity, leading to decreased cortisol production capacity despite adequate enzyme expression. Additionally, inflammatory mediators can directly affect enzyme conformation and activity through post-translational modifications.

Alternative steroidogenic pathways become activated during chronic ACTH stimulation and can lead to increased production of other steroid hormones including androgens and mineralocorticoids that may contribute to clinical symptoms in endometriosis patients. The balance between different steroidogenic pathways depends on the relative expression and activity of various steroidogenic enzymes and can be altered by inflammatory mediators, nutritional factors, and genetic variations in enzyme expression.

The diurnal rhythm of cortisol production depends on the coordinated regulation of the entire HPA axis and involves both central circadian mechanisms and peripheral adrenal clock systems that control the timing of steroidogenic enzyme expression and cortisol synthesis. Chronic inflammation can disrupt these circadian mechanisms and lead to flattened cortisol rhythms, inappropriate cortisol release timing, and altered cortisol clearance that contribute to metabolic dysfunction and sleep disturbances.

Cortisol metabolism and clearance involve hepatic enzymes including 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases that can regenerate active cortisol from inactive cortisone or inactivate cortisol to cortisone. These enzymes can be affected by inflammatory mediators and hepatic dysfunction associated with endotoxemia, leading to altered cortisol clearance and prolonged cortisol exposure that can contribute to glucocorticoid-related side effects and metabolic dysfunction.

## 4.1.5 Glucocorticoid Receptor Function and Cellular Responsiveness

Glucocorticoid receptors (GR) mediate the cellular and physiological effects of cortisol and represent the final common pathway through which HPA axis activation influences target tissue function. In endometriosis-associated chronic inflammation, glucocorticoid receptor function becomes significantly impaired through multiple mechanisms including altered receptor expression, impaired nuclear translocation, and reduced DNA binding affinity that contribute to glucocorticoid resistance and loss of normal cortisol-mediated physiological regulation.

Glucocorticoid receptors exist in the cytoplasm in association with heat shock proteins and other chaperone molecules that maintain the receptor in an inactive but hormone-responsive conformation. Cortisol binding induces conformational changes that lead to dissociation from chaperone proteins, receptor dimerization, and nuclear translocation where the activated receptor complex can bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in target gene promoters. This process can be impaired by inflammatory mediators that affect receptor structure, chaperone function, or nuclear transport mechanisms.

The expression of glucocorticoid receptors is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and can be affected by inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α and IL-1β, which can suppress GR gene expression and reduce cellular glucocorticoid responsiveness. Additionally, inflammatory mediators can affect the stability of GR mRNA and the translation of GR protein, leading to reduced receptor availability even when gene transcription remains intact. These effects contribute to the development of functional glucocorticoid resistance in chronically inflamed tissues.

Post-translational modifications of glucocorticoid receptors, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, significantly affect receptor function and can be altered by inflammatory signaling pathways. Inflammatory kinases can phosphorylate GR at specific serine and threonine residues that reduce DNA binding affinity, impair nuclear translocation, or promote receptor degradation. The pattern of post-translational modifications determines receptor activity and can create tissue-specific variations in glucocorticoid responsiveness.

Nuclear translocation of activated glucocorticoid receptors requires intact nuclear transport machinery and can be impaired by inflammatory mediators that affect importin proteins, nuclear pore function, or the nuclear localization signals on the receptor itself. Oxidative stress associated with chronic inflammation can damage nuclear transport components and reduce the efficiency of receptor nuclear translocation, contributing to glucocorticoid resistance even when receptor expression and cortisol levels remain adequate.

DNA binding affinity of glucocorticoid receptors depends on proper receptor conformation and the accessibility of glucocorticoid response elements in target gene promoters. Inflammatory mediators can induce changes in chromatin structure through effects on histone-modifying enzymes that reduce GRE accessibility and limit glucocorticoid-responsive gene expression. Additionally, inflammatory transcription factors like NF-κB can compete for binding sites and coactivator proteins, reducing the effectiveness of glucocorticoid-mediated transcriptional regulation.

## 4.1.6 Chronic Inflammation-Induced GR Sensitivity Blunting

The development of glucocorticoid resistance represents one of the most important consequences of chronic inflammation and creates a state where normal or even elevated cortisol levels fail to produce appropriate anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects. This resistance develops through multiple mechanisms that reduce cellular responsiveness to glucocorticoids and can become self-perpetuating, contributing to the persistence of inflammatory activation and the failure of endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

Molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance include the induction of inhibitory proteins that interfere with glucocorticoid receptor function, alterations in receptor isoform expression that favor less active receptor variants, and changes in coactivator and corepressor protein availability that affect transcriptional responses to glucocorticoid receptor activation. These mechanisms can operate independently or in combination to reduce glucocorticoid effectiveness and create functional resistance to anti-inflammatory signals.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, can induce the expression of glucocorticoid receptor β (GRβ), a dominant-negative isoform that lacks the ligand-binding domain and cannot be activated by cortisol but can form inactive heterodimers with functional glucocorticoid receptor α (GRα). The increased GRβ expression creates a molecular mechanism for glucocorticoid resistance by sequestering functional receptors and preventing their transcriptional activity.

MAPK pathway activation by inflammatory mediators leads to phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptors at serine residues that reduce DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity. The p38 MAPK and JNK pathways are particularly important for mediating inflammatory effects on glucocorticoid receptor function and can create rapid onset glucocorticoid resistance in response to inflammatory stimuli. These phosphorylation events can be reversed by phosphatases, but chronic inflammation can overwhelm phosphatase capacity and create sustained receptor dysfunction.

NF-κB activation represents another important mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance through direct protein-protein interactions between activated NF-κB subunits and glucocorticoid receptors that prevent DNA binding and transcriptional activation. This interaction creates mutual antagonism where glucocorticoids normally suppress NF-κB activity, but activated NF-κB can prevent glucocorticoid receptor function. In chronic inflammatory conditions, sustained NF-κB activation can create persistent glucocorticoid resistance.

Oxidative stress associated with chronic inflammation can directly modify glucocorticoid receptors through oxidation of critical amino acid residues, particularly cysteine residues that are important for DNA binding and protein structure. These oxidative modifications can reduce receptor function and contribute to glucocorticoid resistance through irreversible chemical alterations of the receptor protein. The accumulation of oxidatively modified receptors can create progressive loss of glucocorticoid responsiveness over time.

## 4.1.7 Stress Response Impairment and Physiological Consequences

The impairment of normal stress responses that occurs in HPA axis dysfunction has profound physiological consequences that extend beyond simple hormonal abnormalities to affect multiple organ systems and physiological processes. The loss of appropriate stress responsiveness can compromise the ability to respond to acute challenges, maintain homeostasis during physiological demands, and coordinate adaptive responses to changing environmental conditions.

Acute stress response impairment manifests as reduced cortisol release in response to physical, psychological, or physiological stressors that would normally activate the HPA axis. This blunted response can leave individuals vulnerable to stress-related complications and may contribute to the increased susceptibility to infections, poor wound healing, and reduced capacity to cope with surgical procedures or other medical interventions commonly observed in endometriosis patients with severe systemic involvement.

Metabolic consequences of HPA axis dysfunction include alterations in glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and protein synthesis that reflect the important role of glucocorticoids in metabolic regulation. Inadequate glucocorticoid signaling can lead to impaired gluconeogenesis, reduced hepatic glucose production, and increased insulin sensitivity that may predispose to hypoglycemia during fasting or stress. Conversely, glucocorticoid resistance can contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

Immune system dysfunction results from the loss of normal glucocorticoid-mediated immune regulation and can manifest as both excessive inflammatory responses and impaired antimicrobial immunity. Glucocorticoids normally provide important anti-inflammatory signals that limit tissue damage during immune responses, and the loss of this regulation can contribute to autoimmune phenomena and chronic inflammatory tissue damage. Additionally, glucocorticoids are important for maintaining normal immune cell development and function.

Cardiovascular effects of HPA axis dysfunction include alterations in blood pressure regulation, cardiac function, and vascular reactivity that reflect the important role of glucocorticoids in cardiovascular homeostasis. Both glucocorticoid deficiency and resistance can affect mineralocorticoid receptor signaling and contribute to electrolyte imbalances, altered blood pressure regulation, and increased cardiovascular risk. The chronic inflammation associated with HPA axis dysfunction further compounds cardiovascular risk.

Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances represent important consequences of HPA axis dysfunction that can have wide-ranging effects on health and quality of life. The normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol release is essential for maintaining circadian physiology, and the loss of this rhythm can contribute to sleep disorders, altered mood regulation, and metabolic dysfunction. The bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbances and HPA axis function can create vicious cycles that perpetuate physiological dysfunction.

Cognitive and mood effects of HPA axis dysfunction include impaired memory formation, altered emotional regulation, and increased susceptibility to mood disorders that reflect the important role of glucocorticoids in brain function. Both glucocorticoid excess and deficiency can affect hippocampal function and neural plasticity, contributing to cognitive impairment and mood disturbances. The chronic fatigue and cognitive dysfunction commonly observed in endometriosis patients may partly reflect HPA axis involvement.

## 4.1.8 Cortisol-Mediated Immune Suppression and Tolerance

The immunosuppressive effects of cortisol represent one of the most important physiological functions of the HPA axis and serve to limit excessive inflammatory responses that could cause tissue damage or autoimmune reactions. However, in chronic inflammatory conditions like endometriosis-associated SIBO, the normal balance between immune activation and suppression becomes disrupted, leading to complex alterations in immune function that can contribute to both excessive inflammation and impaired antimicrobial immunity.

Cortisol exerts immunosuppressive effects through multiple mechanisms including the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production, suppression of immune cell activation and proliferation, and promotion of anti-inflammatory mediator synthesis. These effects normally serve to resolve inflammatory responses and prevent excessive tissue damage, but when cortisol signaling becomes impaired through glucocorticoid resistance, these protective mechanisms fail and inflammatory responses can become uncontrolled and destructive.

T lymphocyte function is particularly sensitive to glucocorticoid effects, with cortisol normally suppressing T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production through effects on T cell receptor signaling, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation. The loss of effective T cell regulation in glucocorticoid resistance can contribute to autoimmune responses and chronic inflammatory activation that characterizes severe endometriosis. Additionally, the altered T cell function can affect immune memory and vaccine responses.

Macrophage polarization is significantly influenced by glucocorticoids, which normally promote anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage activation while suppressing pro-inflammatory M1 responses. This polarization is essential for the resolution of inflammatory responses and the promotion of tissue repair. When glucocorticoid signaling is impaired, macrophages may remain in pro-inflammatory states and contribute to chronic tissue inflammation and damage.

Neutrophil function and trafficking are regulated by glucocorticoids through effects on adhesion molecule expression, chemotaxis, and apoptosis that normally limit neutrophil tissue infiltration and promote the resolution of acute inflammatory responses. Impaired glucocorticoid signaling can lead to excessive neutrophil activation and tissue infiltration that contributes to inflammatory tissue damage and the persistence of inflammatory responses.

The development of immune tolerance to self-antigens and environmental factors depends partly on glucocorticoid-mediated immune regulation, and the impairment of this regulation can contribute to autoimmune responses and allergic reactions. The loss of normal immune tolerance mechanisms may explain the increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions and allergic reactions observed in endometriosis patients with significant systemic involvement.

## 4.1.9 Feedback Loop Disruption and Homeostatic Failure

The normal function of the HPA axis depends on sophisticated feedback mechanisms that ensure appropriate responses to stress while preventing excessive or prolonged activation that could be harmful. In chronic inflammatory conditions like endometriosis-associated SIBO, these feedback mechanisms become disrupted through multiple pathways, leading to loss of normal homeostatic regulation and the development of pathological activation patterns that can perpetuate disease processes.

Negative feedback regulation normally occurs at multiple levels of the HPA axis, with cortisol providing inhibitory signals to both hypothalamic CRH neurons and pituitary corticotroph cells that limit the duration and magnitude of stress responses. This feedback requires functional glucocorticoid receptors in both the hypothalamus and pituitary, and the development of glucocorticoid resistance can impair this essential regulatory mechanism, leading to inappropriate HPA axis activation.

The fast feedback mechanism involves rapid cortisol effects on hypothalamic and pituitary function that occur within minutes of cortisol elevation and serve to limit acute stress responses. This mechanism depends on membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors and rapid signaling pathways that can be impaired by inflammatory mediators affecting membrane function or rapid signaling mechanisms. The loss of fast feedback can contribute to excessive stress responses and difficulty terminating stress activation.

Slow feedback mechanisms involve genomic effects of cortisol that occur over hours to days and regulate the synthesis of CRH and ACTH through transcriptional mechanisms. These mechanisms require functional nuclear glucocorticoid receptors and intact transcriptional machinery, both of which can be impaired in chronic inflammatory conditions. The loss of slow feedback contributes to sustained HPA axis activation and the development of chronic stress-related symptoms.

Feed-forward mechanisms that normally amplify stress responses when appropriate can become pathologically activated in chronic inflammatory conditions, creating self-perpetuating cycles of HPA axis activation. Inflammatory cytokines can create feed-forward loops by stimulating CRH release while simultaneously impairing cortisol-mediated feedback inhibition, leading to progressive loss of HPA axis regulation.

Circadian feedback mechanisms that normally coordinate HPA axis function with daily rhythms can become disrupted by chronic inflammation through effects on molecular clock mechanisms in both central and peripheral tissues. The loss of circadian HPA axis regulation contributes to sleep disturbances, metabolic dysfunction, and altered stress responsiveness that can significantly impact quality of life and physiological function.

The restoration of normal feedback regulation requires addressing both the underlying inflammatory processes and the specific mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance, making HPA axis dysfunction a complex therapeutic challenge that may require multifaceted interventions targeting inflammation, receptor function, and circadian physiology simultaneously.
