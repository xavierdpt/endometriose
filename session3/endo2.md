Stopped at aromatase-est, reference 3


# Next steps

For each affirmation in the json files, we want a new markdown file in the folder subtopics for this affirmation.
This new file name must be added to the affirmation in the json files.

Each of this file will be structured as follow:
a) Section common to all subtopic files with a single paragraph that is a remainder of the global thesis of the file endo.md
b) Section with a single line that states which affirmation is going to be studied in this subtopic file
c) Section with up to three paragraphs that states of this affirmation can be used to support the global thesis, and mentions which biochemical pathways are involved and how.
d) For each of the urls in references and counter_references of the affirmation in the json files, a section that
d.1) Indicates the url of the reference
d.2) Contains on assessment paragraph about whether the url supports the paragraph c) or contradicts the paragraph c)
e) Conclusion section with up to three paragraphs that summarizes the result of this work with a conclusion

# Paragraph for item a)

This research investigates the complex pathophysiological pathway linking endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome through a cascade of interconnected mechanisms. The central thesis proposes that endometriosis, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue and chronic inflammatory processes, can disrupt gastrointestinal function and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This potential SIBO-endometriosis combination can create a state of amplified systemic inflammation through bacterial endotoxin release and immune dysregulation, which may subsequently disrupt thyroidal and neuroendocrine function via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The resulting metabolic suppression, neuroinflammation, and perpetuation of pathological inflammatory cycles can ultimately manifest as chronic fatigue syndrome, creating a self-reinforcing pathological state that requires integrated therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

# Files initialization

To perform the file initialization, write a node program that
a) List the affirmations that have no subtopic file name in the json files
b) Check that for affirmations that have subtopic files, all file names are unique, and report file names that are identical for different affirmations, or that have names longer that 15 characters.
c) Create empty files for each valid filename in the subtopics folder
d) Delete files of the subtopics folder that are not referenced in the json files

## How to use the file-initializer.js program

The Node.js program `file-initializer.js` has been created to automate the file initialization process. 

### Running the program
```bash
node file-initializer.js
```

### What the program does
1. **Scans all JSON files** matching the pattern `ch#-s#-*.json` in the current directory
2. **Loads all affirmations** from these files and checks for `subtopic_file` fields
3. **Reports missing subtopic filenames** - affirmations without the `subtopic_file` field
4. **Validates existing filenames** for:
   - Uniqueness across all affirmations
   - Maximum length of 15 characters
5. **Creates the `subtopics` folder** if it doesn't exist
6. **Creates empty `.md` files** for all valid subtopic filenames in the `subtopics` folder
7. **Removes unreferenced files** from the `subtopics` folder that aren't mentioned in any JSON file

### Adding subtopic filenames to JSON files
To use this program effectively, you need to add a `subtopic_file` field to each affirmation in your JSON files:

```json
{
  "affirmation": "Your affirmation text here",
  "subtopic_file": "short-name",
  "references": [...],
  "counter_references": [...]
}
```

**Naming requirements:**
- Maximum 15 characters
- Must be unique across all JSON files
- Will automatically get `.md` extension when creating files
- Use descriptive but concise names (e.g., "endo-implant", "sibo-lps", "t3-convert")

# Content initialization

After running the file-initializer.js program to create the empty subtopic files, a second Node.js program should be created to populate these files with their initial content structure.

## Content initializer program

The `content-initializer.js` program will:

1. **Read all JSON files** to extract affirmations with their `subtopic_file` references
2. **For each existing subtopic file** in the `subtopics` folder that corresponds to a JSON affirmation:
   - Generate the complete initial markdown structure
   - Populate sections a) through e) as defined in the file structure requirements
3. **Generate structured content** including:
   - **Section a)**: Insert the common global thesis paragraph
   - **Section b)**: Extract and format the specific affirmation being studied
   - **Section c)**: Create placeholder structure for analysis paragraphs with biochemical pathway mentions
   - **Section d)**: Generate reference sections for each URL in `references` and `counter_references` arrays
   - **Section e)**: Create placeholder conclusion structure
4. **Verify files are empty** - the program expects subtopic files to be empty as created by `file-initializer.js`
5. **Support selective overwriting** - provide command-line options to overwrite specific files if needed
6. **Generate consistent formatting** with proper markdown headers and structure

### Usage
```bash
# Initialize all empty subtopic files with template structure
node content-initializer.js

# Overwrite specific subtopic files with fresh template (use with caution)
node content-initializer.js --overwrite filename1.md filename2.md

# Overwrite all subtopic files regardless of current content
node content-initializer.js --overwrite-all
```

### Important notes
- The program expects subtopic files to be empty (as created by `file-initializer.js`)
- Use the `--overwrite` option carefully as it will replace existing content
- Files should be backed up before using overwrite options
- This program should be run after `file-initializer.js` has created the empty subtopic files and all JSON files have been properly configured with `subtopic_file` fields


Read this document and fill the Pathophysiological Analysis section, do not use web search.

Use fetch webpage and perform the assessesment for reference 1 (one paragraph).

# Synthesis and Conclusions

[This section must explains which claims of the Pathophysiological Analysis section are substantiated by the reference assessments, contradicted by the reference assessments, or lacking evidence. When lacking evidence, it must explain if the lacking evidence is indirectly substantiated or contradicted by the references (and how), or requires looking for additional references.]

# Pathophysiological Analysis (Revised)

[This section must contain a revision of the Pathophysiological Analysis section that takes into account everything that has been said in the assessments and in the synthesis and conclusions, and cite the references that are applicable. It must still be three paragraphs.]



Instead of using Reference 1, 2, etc.., include the file name without the extension in the reference, e.g Reference {filename}/1. Update this document accordingly.
