SIBO is characterized by an overgrowth of facultative anaerobes in the proximal small intestine, leading to excess gas production and increased intestinal permeability. Endotoxins (LPS, peptidoglycan) translocate across a compromised mucosal barrier, engaging innate immune sensors and amplifying circulating levels of IL‑6, IL‑1β, and TNF‑α. These cytokines act on the central nervous system via the vagal afferent pathway and the cytokine‑hypothalamic axis, resulting in sickness‑behavior manifestations that overlap with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) symptomatology. Moreover, chronic cytokine exposure downregulates mitochondrial complex I activity and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributing to the bioenergetic failure observed in ME/CFS patients.

Develop this paragraph into a long technical essay that describes all the details. Focus on these topics:
- cytokines act on the central nervous system (how)
- vagal afferent pathway (what is it, how does it work in normal conditiosn)
- cytokine‑hypothalamic axis (what is it, how does it work in normal conditions)
- sickness‑behavior manifestations (such as what ? what the biochemical pathways that lead to those manifestations ?)
- chronic cytokine exposure downregulates mitochondrial complex I activity : why, how ? what is mitochondrial complex I ? is there mitochondrial complex II ?
- increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) : how ?
