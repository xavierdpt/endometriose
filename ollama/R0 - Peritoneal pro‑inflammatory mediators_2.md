## The Peritoneal Microenvironment in Endometriosis: An Immunological Perspective  

Endometriosis is an estrogen‑dependent, chronic inflammatory disease in which endometrial‑like tissue grows outside the uterine cavity. The ectopic lesions elicit a distinctive peritoneal milieu that is rich in pro‑inflammatory cytokines (TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑17, TGF‑β) and is characterized by heightened Toll‑like receptor (TLR) signalling in resident macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Understanding the identities, functions, and signalling cascades of these mediators is essential for dissecting the pathogenesis of endometriosis and for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

### 1. Pro‑inflammatory Cytokines in Endometriosis

| Cytokine | Cell Sources (Endometriosis) | Key Functions | Biochemical Pathways |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **TNF‑α** | Endometriotic stromal cells, macrophages, DCs, epithelial cells, infiltrating neutrophils | Induces cell adhesion molecules (ICAM‑1, VCAM‑1), chemokine production (CXCL1, CXCL8), apoptosis, and angiogenesis | **TNFR1/TNFR2 →** MyD88‑independent (TRADD, TRAF2, RIPK1) → **NF‑κB** (canonical), **JNK**/p38 MAPK, **caspase‑8** (apoptosis) |
| **IL‑1β** | Macrophages, DCs, endometrial stromal cells, fibroblasts | Promotes NF‑κB activation, up‑regulates COX‑2, prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) synthesis, enhances cell proliferation | **IL‑1R1 → MyD88 → IRAK4/IRAK1 → TRAF6 → TAK1 → IKK complex → NF‑κB**; also **p38 MAPK** |
| **IL‑17 (IL‑17A)** | Th17 cells, innate lymphoid cells‑3 (ILC3), γδ T cells, neutrophils | Drives recruitment of neutrophils, induces CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8; stimulates fibroblast proliferation and VEGF production | **IL‑17RA/RC → Act1 → TRAF6 → NF‑κB, MAPKs**; cooperates with TNF‑α for maximal effect |
| **TGF‑β (TGF‑β1)** | Endometrial stromal cells, macrophages, DCs, peritoneal fibroblasts | Dual role: early anti‑inflammatory (inducing Tregs, inhibiting NF‑κB), later pro‑fibrotic (SMAD2/3 signalling, collagen production), promotes angiogenesis via VEGF induction | **TGF‑βRII → TGF‑βRI → SMAD2/3 phosphorylation → SMAD4 → transcription**; non‑canonical **PI3K/AKT**, **MAPK**, **Rho‑GTPase** pathways |

#### Why These Cytokines Matter in Endometriosis

1. **Sustaining the Lesion** – TNF‑α and IL‑1β maintain an autocrine loop that encourages endometrial‑like cell proliferation and survival.  
2. **Promoting Angiogenesis** – VEGF induced by TNF‑α, IL‑17, and TGF‑β is essential for neovascularisation of ectopic foci.  
3. **Facilitating Pain** – Neuro‑sensitisation is driven by IL‑1β, TNF‑α, and IL‑17 through modulation of nociceptive nerve growth and ion channel expression.  
4. **Immune Dysregulation** – The cytokine milieu skews peritoneal macrophages towards an M2‑like, pro‑fibrotic phenotype, while DCs fail to promote effective T‑cell clearance of ectopic tissue.

### 2. Toll‑Like Receptor (TLR) Signalling in Resident Macrophages and Dendritic Cells

#### 2.1 Definition and Ligands

- **TLRs** are pattern‑recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on innate immune cells.  
- They detect microbe‑associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4), CpG DNA (TLR9), lipopeptides (TLR2), and viral RNA (TLR3, TLR7/8).  
- In endometriosis, endogenous ligands (damage‑associated molecular patterns, DAMPs) such as HMGB1, extracellular matrix fragments, and even bacterial DNA from the gut or vaginal flora can engage TLRs.

#### 2.2 Signalling Cascades

| TLR | Adapter Protein | Key Transcription Factors | Downstream Cytokines |
|-----|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **TLR2/4** | MyD88 (except TLR4 can also use TRIF) | NF‑κB, AP‑1 | TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6, IL‑8 |
| **TLR3, TLR7/8** | TRIF (TLR3) or MyD88 (TLR7/8) | IRF3, IRF7, NF‑κB | IFN‑α/β, IL‑6 |
| **TLR9** | MyD88 | NF‑κB, IRF7 | IL‑12, TNF‑α, IFN‑γ |

**Macrophages**: TLR activation polarises macrophages toward an M1 (pro‑inflammatory) phenotype, but chronic stimulation (e.g., persistent DAMPs) may drive a switch to an M2 phenotype that supports fibrosis and immune suppression.

**Dendritic Cells**: TLR ligation matures DCs, enhancing MHC‑II expression, costimulatory molecules (CD80/86), and cytokine production. However, in endometriosis, DCs often adopt a tolerogenic phenotype, releasing IL‑10 and TGF‑β, impairing effective T‑cell responses.

#### 2.3 Relevance to Endometriosis

- **Activation of Endometriotic Lesions**: TLR2 and TLR4 are overexpressed in endometriotic stromal cells, making them responsive to bacterial LPS and HMGB1, which increases local cytokine production.  
- **Chronic Inflammation**: Continuous TLR engagement by endogenous DAMPs sustains a low‑grade inflammatory state.  
- **Immune Escape**: TLR‑induced TGF‑β and IL‑10 from DCs promote regulatory T cells, dampening anti‑lesion immunity.

### 3. Resident Macrophages in the Peritoneal Cavity

#### 3.1 Origin and Phenotype

- **Macrophages** are seeded during embryogenesis (yolk‑sac derived) and are maintained by local proliferation.  
- **Peritoneal Macrophages** display two subsets:  
  - **Large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs)**: F4/80^hi, high phagocytic capacity, express MHC‑II.  
  - **Small peritoneal macrophages (SPMs)**: F4/80^lo, enriched for TLRs, rapid response cells.  

#### 3.2 Functions in Endometriosis

- **Phagocytosis of Menstrual Debris**: Under normal conditions, LPMs clear shed endometrial cells, preventing implantation.  
- **Cytokine Production**: In endometriosis, macrophages produce TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6, and IL‑10 in response to TLR ligands and DAMPs.  
- **Angiogenesis Support**: Secretion of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).  
- **Fibrosis Induction**: M2‑polarised macrophages secrete TGF‑β, promoting extracellular matrix deposition around lesions.  

#### 3.3 Dysregulation

- **Phenotypic Shift**: Chronic exposure to TNF‑α and IL‑1β can push macrophages toward an M2‑like phenotype with high arginase‑1, IL‑10, and TGF‑β production, supporting lesion persistence.  
- **Impaired Clearance**: Reduced phagocytic activity due to altered expression of scavenger receptors (e.g., CD206) allows ectopic implantation.

### 4. Dendritic Cells (DCs) in the Peritoneum

#### 4.1 Subsets and Localization

- **Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)**: Type‑I IFN producers.  
- **Conventional DCs (cDC1 and cDC2)**: Cross‑presentation (cDC1) and helper T‑cell priming (cDC2).  
- In the peritoneal cavity, **cDC2** predominates and is responsible for antigen presentation to CD4^+ T cells.

#### 4.2 Roles in Endometriosis

- **Antigen Presentation**: Endometriotic antigens presented to T cells should ideally trigger cytotoxic responses, but instead, a tolerogenic DC phenotype promotes regulatory T cells (Tregs).  
- **Cytokine Secretion**: DCs secrete IL‑10, TGF‑β, and IL‑6 upon TLR activation, contributing to a pro‑inflammatory and immunosuppressive environment.  
- **T‑cell Skewing**: Elevated IL‑1β and TNF‑α favour Th17 differentiation, which in turn produces IL‑17, reinforcing inflammation and lesion growth.

#### 4.3 Modulating Factors

- **Endometriotic Fluid**: Contains increased TGF‑β, IL‑1β, and DAMPs, which drive DC maturation into a tolerogenic phenotype.  
- **Microbial Translocation**: Bacterial DNA from the gut can reach the peritoneal cavity via the lymphatics, further stimulating DC TLR9.

### 5. Why These Interactions Are Particularly Interesting in Endometriosis

1. **Intersection of Innate and Adaptive Immunity**: Endometriosis blurs the lines between tissue‑resident immunity and systemic immune regulation. The TLR‑driven cytokine network is the bridge linking innate pattern recognition to adaptive T‑cell responses.  

2. **Therapeutic Opportunities**: Targeting TLR signalling (e.g., TLR4 antagonists) or modulating cytokine pathways (e.g., TNF‑α blockers, IL‑17 inhibitors, TGF‑β signalling blockers) holds promise for disease‑modifying therapy beyond hormonal suppression.  

3. **Pain Mechanisms**: IL‑1β, TNF‑α, and IL‑17 sensitize nociceptive neurons; blocking these pathways may reduce chronic pelvic pain, a major clinical burden.  

4. **Diagnostic Biomarkers**: Levels of peritoneal TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑17, or TGF‑β correlate with disease severity, providing potential fluid‑based diagnostic markers.  

5. **Understanding Immune Evasion**: The capacity of ectopic lesions to evade immune clearance reflects a complex interplay between macrophage/dendritic cell phenotypes and cytokine milieu, shedding light on the broader principles of tumour‑immune interactions.

### 6. Peritoneal Microenvironment in Healthy Individuals vs. Endometriosis

| Feature | Healthy Peritoneum | Endometriosis |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Cytokine Baseline** | Low TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑17, TGF‑β (e.g., < 1‑2 pg/mL) | Elevated (often 10‑100 pg/mL) |
| **TLR Activation** | Minimal; only low‑level surveillance | Chronic due to DAMPs (HMGB1, extracellular matrix fragments) and microbial DNA |
| **Macrophage Phenotype** | Predominantly LPMs, M1‑like, efficient clearance | Mixed M1/M2, with a bias toward M2 in lesions |
| **DC Function** | Antigen‑presenting, Th1/Th17 priming | Tolerogenic, Treg induction |
| **Immune Surveillance** | Adequate clearance of shed endometrium | Impaired clearance, allowing ectopic implantation |
| **Regulatory Factors** | Balanced IL‑10/TGF‑β, maintaining homeostasis | Dysregulated TGF‑β (high early, pro‑fibrotic later) |

#### Why the Healthy Peritoneum Is Less Inflamed

1. **Immune Tolerance to Menstrual Debris** – The peritoneum is exposed daily to shed endometrial tissue. An immunoregulatory environment (IL‑10, TGF‑β, regulatory macrophages) prevents auto‑inflammation.  
2. **Microbial Barrier** – The peritoneal cavity is normally sterile; absence of microbial MAMPs limits TLR activation.  
3. **Controlled Lymphatic Drainage** – Efficient clearance of cytokines and debris by lymphatics keeps local concentrations low.  
4. **Regulatory Cell Populations** – Resident regulatory T cells and tolerogenic DCs maintain equilibrium.  

#### Sources of Pro‑inflammatory Mediators in Endometriosis

- **Retrograde Menstruation**: Menstrual fluid entering the peritoneal cavity carries endometrial cells and associated cytokines.  
- **Endometriotic Lesions**: Ectopic stromal and epithelial cells produce TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6, and IL‑17 autonomously.  
- **Resident Immune Cells**: Macrophages and DCs, once activated by DAMPs, become prolific cytokine producers.  
- **Microbial Translocation**: Bacterial components from the gut or vagina (via translocation or ascending infection) provide TLR ligands.  
- **Fibroblasts & Mesothelial Cells**: Respond to cytokines and produce TGF‑β, IL‑6, and chemokines that recruit further immune cells.

### 7. Concluding Remarks

The peritoneal microenvironment in endometriosis is a complex network where cytokine production, TLR signalling, and immune cell phenotypes interlock to create a self‑sustaining, pro‑inflammatory state. The over‑expression of TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑17, and TGF‑β in concert with heightened TLR activation in resident macrophages and dendritic cells fuels lesion survival, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and chronic pain. In contrast, a healthy peritoneum maintains low cytokine levels through robust immune tolerance and efficient clearance mechanisms.

Elucidating these pathways not only deepens our understanding of endometriosis pathogenesis but also highlights potential therapeutic intervention points—TLR antagonists, cytokine inhibitors, or modulators of macrophage/ DC polarization—that could disrupt the vicious cycle of inflammation and provide relief for millions of affected women.
