I read that the peritoneal microenvironment in endometriosis is rich in pro‑inflammatory mediators—TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑17, and TGF‑β—that engage Toll‑like receptor (TLR) signaling in resident macrophages and dendritic cells. 

Write a detailed technical essay on TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑17, TGF‑β, Toll‑like receptor (TLR) signaling, resident macrophages, dendritic cells. Define them, describe what they do and the biochemical pathways they are involved in that are relevant to endometriosis. Why is it interseting to discuss these in that context ? Also the peritoneal microenvironment in somebody that doesn't have endometriosis is less rich in those pro‑inflammatory mediators, why ? Where do they come from ?
