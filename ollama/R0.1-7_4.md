**Pairwise Causality/Association Matrix**  
(“X → Y” = *strong evidence that the presence or exacerbation of X causally or mechanistically drives Y*; “Y → X” = *reverse implication*; “X ⟂ Y” = *independent or no documented causal link*.)

| Pair | Relation |
|------|----------|
| **Endometriosis ↔ SIBO** | **Endometriosis → SIBO** (mechanical obstruction, altered motility, peritoneal fluid‑mediated inflammation promote bacterial overgrowth); **SIBO ↛ Endometriosis** (no evidence that bacterial overgrowth initiates ectopic endometrial implants). |
| **Endometriosis ↔ Chronic Fatigue** | **Endometriosis → Chronic Fatigue** (systemic cytokine production, hormonal dysregulation, neuro‑immune cross‑talk generate fatigue‑like symptoms); **Chronic Fatigue ↛ Endometriosis** (fatigue does not initiate endometrial lesions). |
| **SIBO ↔ Chronic Fatigue** | **SIBO → Chronic Fatigue** (endotoxin‑driven cytokine cascade impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and CNS homeostasis); **Chronic Fatigue ↛ SIBO** (fatigue alone does not create bacterial overgrowth). |
| **Endometriosis ↔ Thyroid/Cortisol (HPA axis)** | **Endometriosis → Thyroid/Cortisol dysregulation** (cytokines alter deiodinase activity, GR sensitivity, and HPA feedback); **Thyroid/Cortisol dysregulation ↛ Endometriosis** (thyroid or cortisol abnormalities have not been shown to precipitate ectopic implantation). |
| **Endometriosis ↔ Immune Dysfunction** | **Endometriosis → Immune Dysfunction** (local and systemic inflammation skew Th1/Th17/Treg balance, impair NK activity); **Immune Dysfunction ↛ Endometriosis** (immune defects are not sufficient to create endometrial implants). |
| **Endometriosis ↔ Gluten Allergy** | **Endometriosis ↛ Gluten Allergy** (no proven causal link); **Gluten Allergy ↛ Endometriosis** (gluten intolerance does not trigger ectopic endometrium). |
| **SIBO ↔ Thyroid/Cortisol** | **SIBO → Thyroid/Cortisol** (cytokine‑mediated gut‑liver axis can alter deiodinase activity and HPA responsiveness); **Thyroid/Cortisol Dysregulation ↛ SIBO** (thyroid or cortisol changes alone do not cause bacterial overgrowth). |
| **SIBO ↔ Immune Dysfunction** | **SIBO → Immune Dysfunction** (LPS translocation induces systemic inflammation and immune exhaustion); **Immune Dysfunction ↛ SIBO** (immune deficits do not directly generate bacterial overgrowth). |
| **SIBO ↔ Gluten Allergy** | **SIBO ↛ Gluten Allergy** (bacterial overgrowth does not trigger IgA/IgG anti‑gliadin); **Gluten Allergy ↛ SIBO** (gluten intolerance does not cause bacterial overgrowth, though both can coexist via gut barrier compromise). |
| **Thyroid/Cortisol ↔ Immune Dysfunction** | **Thyroid/Cortisol → Immune Dysfunction** (autoimmune thyroid disease and glucocorticoid resistance alter cytokine profiles); **Immune Dysfunction → Thyroid/Cortisol** (autoimmune states can precipitate thyroiditis and HPA axis changes). |
| **Thyroid/Cortisol ↔ Gluten Allergy** | **Thyroid/Cortisol ↛ Gluten Allergy** (thyroid or cortisol abnormalities are not triggers for celiac disease); **Gluten Allergy ↛ Thyroid/Cortisol** (gluten sensitivity does not initiate thyroid or HPA dysfunction). |
| **Immune Dysfunction ↔ Chronic Fatigue** | **Immune Dysfunction → Chronic Fatigue** (pro‑inflammatory cytokines impair CNS energy metabolism); **Chronic Fatigue ↛ Immune Dysfunction** (fatigue alone does not generate immune skewing). |
| **Gluten Allergy ↔ Chronic Fatigue** | **Gluten Allergy → Chronic Fatigue** (mild systemic inflammation from celiac disease can contribute to fatigue); **Chronic Fatigue ↛ Gluten Allergy** (fatigue does not cause IgA/IgG anti‑gliadin responses). |

**Interpretative Notes**

1. **Directionality vs. Co‑occurrence** – The “→” symbol is used where a clear mechanistic pathway has been demonstrated (e.g., endometrial cytokines → HPA axis resistance). In contrast, “↛” indicates that the reverse pathway lacks empirical support, though the conditions may still co‑exist due to shared risk factors (e.g., autoimmune predisposition).

2. **Complex Feedback Loops** – Some pairs are inherently bi‑directional once a cascade is initiated. For instance, immune dysfunction can foster a pro‑inflammatory milieu that perpetuates HPA axis dysregulation, which in turn further dampens immune regulation, forming a vicious cycle. These are noted in the table with a bidirectional arrow (↔) or two single arrows.

3. **Independent Variables** – Pairs marked “⟂” have been investigated with no compelling evidence that one condition predisposes or results from the other, even though they may share common etiologic factors such as gut microbiota dysbiosis or genetic susceptibility.

4. **Clinical Implications** – Recognizing the dominant directionality (e.g., Endometriosis → SIBO) suggests that therapeutic targeting of the upstream condition (e.g., surgical or hormonal ablation of endometriotic lesions, pro‑inflammatory cytokine blockade) may ameliorate downstream complications (bacterial overgrowth, chronic fatigue). Conversely, conditions with a reverse implication (e.g., Immune Dysfunction → Thyroid/Cortisol) imply that immunomodulatory interventions could stabilize endocrine function.

5. **Open Questions** – Although the table reflects current evidence, many mechanistic links remain incompletely characterized. For example, whether gut‑derived endotoxin in SIBO can precipitate endometriosis through local peritoneal inflammation is still speculative and warrants focused longitudinal studies.

This concise mapping should facilitate hypothesis generation for multi‑disciplinary research teams exploring the intricate web of interactions among endometriosis, chronic fatigue, SIBO, thyroid/Cortisol axis, immune dysfunction, and gluten allergy.
