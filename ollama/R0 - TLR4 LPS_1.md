I read that activation of TLR4 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released from gut translocation induces NF‑κB‑dependent transcription of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP‑9, MMP‑14), which degrade tight‑junction proteins (occludin, claudin‑3) in the intestinal epithelium, facilitating a “leaky gut” phenotype. 

What is TLR4 ? What is lipopolysaccharide ? Why is it released from gut translocation ? What is lipopolysaccharide usually supposed to do ? This is in the context of endometriosis.


Write a short technical essay that focuses on this lipopolysaccharide.
