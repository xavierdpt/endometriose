This is very technical, explain this in less technical terms so that a patient can understand and assess whether it applies to the situation of the patient, which relevant question to ask to doctors.

Endometriosis‑Induced Mechanical and Biofluidic Perturbations of the Intestinal Milieu
Endometrial implants within the serosa or muscularis of the bowel provoke local desmoplasia and dysmotility, producing both static and pulsatile luminal obstructions that alter peristaltic kinetics. The resultant stasis favors anaerobic bacterial proliferation, shifting the gut microbiome toward a pathobiontic phenotype that may predispose to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Furthermore, ectopic endometrial tissue secretes estrogen‑responsive cytokines (IL‑6, IL‑8, VEGF) that accumulate in the peritoneal fluid, increasing osmotic pressure and driving ascitic expansion; this fluid redistribution exerts shear stress on adjacent enteric plexuses and can compromise mucosal integrity. Could the chronic mechanical stress and cytokine‑laden peritoneal fluid from endometriosis be the initiating trigger for trans‑intestinal barrier dysfunction and subsequent SIBO?
