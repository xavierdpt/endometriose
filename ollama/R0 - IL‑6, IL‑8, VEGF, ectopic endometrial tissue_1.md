I read that ectopic endometrial tissue secretes estrogen‑responsive cytokines (IL‑6, IL‑8, VEGF) .
Why ? What else secretes these cytokines ? Why do they do that ? What is the role of these cytokines ? Is that secretion a property of the ectopic endometrial tissue or is it a consequence of it's location in an unexpected environment ? Is it in reaction to substances that are in the environment of the ectopic endometrial tissue ? Does the non-ectopic endoetrial tissue also secretes estrogen‑responsive cytokines (IL‑6, IL‑8, VEGF) ? What happens when estrogen meets these cytokines ? What are the biochemical pathways ? Write a technical academic essay.
