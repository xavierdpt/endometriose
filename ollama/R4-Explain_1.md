This is very technical, explain this in less technical terms so that a patient can understand and assess whether it applies to the situation of the patient, which relevant question to ask to doctors.

Thyroid Hormone Dysregulation, Immune Modulation, and Endometriosis
Thyroid hormones (T3/T4) regulate basal metabolic rate and modulate T‑cell differentiation via transcriptional control of the IL‑2 receptor and FOXP3 expression. Hypothyroidism is associated with a shift toward a Th2 immune phenotype and reduced natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, whereas hyperthyroidism can potentiate a pro‑inflammatory milieu characterized by elevated IL‑6 and TNF‑α. In endometriosis, altered local estrogen metabolism upregulates deiodinase type 2 (D2), increasing intratumoral T3 levels, which may stimulate fibrotic remodeling through TGF‑β signaling. Additionally, thyroid hormone receptors (TRα, TRβ) cross‑talk with estrogen receptor‑α (ER‑α) to modulate the transcription of genes involved in angiogenesis (VEGF) and matrix degradation (MMP‑2). Could subclinical thyroid dysfunction amplify endometriotic lesion persistence and thereby exacerbate systemic immune activation and fatigue?
