**Lipopolysaccharide in Endometriosis: From Gut Translocation to MMP‑Mediated Barrier Dysfunction**

**1. Introduction**  
Endometriosis is an estrogen‑dependent, chronic inflammatory disease in which endometrial‑like tissue grows outside the uterine cavity. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial; a growing body of evidence implicates the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier integrity, and systemic innate immune signaling in disease onset and progression. Central to this nexus is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the principal endotoxin of Gram‑negative bacteria. Here we review LPS biology, its release by gut translocation, and how it engages Toll‑like receptor 4 (TLR4) to trigger NF‑κB‑dependent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, thereby compromising tight‑junction (TJ) proteins and fostering a “leaky gut” phenotype that may fuel endometriosis.

**2. LPS: Structure and Conventional Immunological Role**  
LPS is a glycolipid constituting the outer leaflet of the Gram‑negative bacterial outer membrane. It consists of three parts:

| Domain | Composition | Function |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Lipid A | Dimeric phospholipid with two acyl chains | Endotoxic core; binds TLR4–MD2 complex |
| Core oligosaccharide | Non‑reducing hexasaccharide + KDO | Provides structural rigidity |
| O‑antigen | Variable polysaccharide repeat units | Mediates immune evasion, serotype specificity |

The immune system views lipid A as a danger signal. In host cells, LPS is presented to the TLR4/MD‑2 heterodimer (often with the co‑receptor CD14) on the plasma membrane of macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. Ligand binding induces TLR4 dimerization and recruitment of adaptor proteins (MyD88, TRIF), culminating in NF‑κB and interferon regulatory factor activation. The downstream transcriptional program produces pro‑inflammatory cytokines (TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6), chemokines, and acute‑phase proteins.

**3. Gut Translocation of LPS: Mechanisms and Drivers**  
“Gut translocation” refers to the passage of luminal bacterial products—including LPS—into the systemic circulation. Several mechanisms can breach the intestinal barrier:

1. **Altered microbiota (dysbiosis)** – Overgrowth of Gram‑negative species increases the luminal LPS load.
2. **Reduced mucin secretion** – Mucus layers normally trap microbes; loss of mucus permits bacterial proximity to epithelial cells.
3. **Decreased tight‑junction integrity** – Proteins such as occludin, claudin‑3, and ZO‑1 form the paracellular seal; inflammatory cytokines or bacterial enzymes (including MMPs) degrade these components.
4. **Oxidative stress** – Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by epithelial or immune cells can disrupt TJ proteins.

Once TJs are compromised, LPS can cross the epithelium, enter the lamina propria, and drain into mesenteric lymphatics, eventually reaching the portal and systemic circulation.

**4. LPS–TLR4 Signaling in the Intestine**  
In the intestinal epithelium, TLR4 resides primarily on the basolateral surface; apical LPS is usually less immunogenic due to MD‑2 shielding. However, with increased permeability, LPS can reach basolateral receptors. Binding triggers the canonical MyD88‑dependent pathway:

1. **TLR4 dimerization** → recruitment of MyD88 and IRAK4/1 → TRAF6 → TAK1 → IKK complex.
2. **IKK phosphorylates IκBα**, releasing NF‑κB (p65/p50) to the nucleus.
3. **NF‑κB transcription** drives genes for cytokines, chemokines, and crucially, MMPs (MMP‑9, MMP‑14).

Simultaneously, TLR4 can signal via TRIF, promoting IRF3‑mediated type‑I interferon production, which further modulates immune responses.

**5. MMP Induction and Tight‑Junction Degradation**  
MMP‑9 (gelatinase B) and MMP‑14 (MT1‑MMP) are zinc‑dependent proteases that degrade extracellular matrix components and cell‑cell junctional proteins. NF‑κB‑mediated upregulation of these MMPs in epithelial cells leads to:

- **Cleavage of occludin and claudin‑3** → loss of TJ integrity.
- **Release of extracellular matrix fragments** that can act as damage‑associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), perpetuating inflammation.
- **Enhanced paracellular flux** of luminal antigens, further stimulating innate immune cells.

This creates a positive feedback loop: LPS → TLR4 → NF‑κB → MMPs → TJ breakdown → more LPS leakage.

**6. Relevance to Endometriosis**  
The link between gut permeability and endometriosis emerges from several observations:

1. **Systemic low‑grade inflammation** is a hallmark of endometriosis; circulating cytokines (TNF‑α, IL‑6) can modulate eutopic endometrial receptivity and ectopic lesion survival.
2. **Elevated serum LPS** has been reported in women with endometriosis compared with controls, suggesting enhanced gut leakage.
3. **MMP overexpression** in endometriotic lesions is well documented; MMPs facilitate stromal invasion, angiogenesis, and lesion expansion.
4. **Gut‑microbiota profiles** differ in endometriosis patients, with higher Gram‑negative abundance correlating with symptom severity.

Thus, LPS translocation may contribute to the inflammatory milieu that supports endometrial implantation outside the uterus. Additionally, NF‑κB activation within the peritoneal cavity can directly stimulate resident macrophages and fibroblasts to produce MMPs and cytokines, reinforcing lesion establishment.

**7. Conclusion**  
Lipopolysaccharide is a potent endotoxin whose translocation across a compromised intestinal barrier can activate TLR4 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to NF‑κB‑driven MMP expression and tight‑junction degradation. In the context of endometriosis, this gut‑originated inflammatory cascade may amplify systemic and local inflammation, fostering an environment conducive to ectopic endometrial growth. Therapeutic strategies that restore barrier integrity, modulate gut microbiota, or inhibit TLR4/MMP signaling could thus hold promise in mitigating endometriosis‑related inflammation and disease progression.
