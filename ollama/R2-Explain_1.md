This is very technical, explain this in less technical terms so that a patient can understand and assess whether it applies to the situation of the patient, which relevant question to ask to doctors.

Peritoneal Cytokine Dynamics and Gut Barrier Integrity in Endometriosis
The peritoneal microenvironment in endometriosis is rich in pro‑inflammatory mediators—TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑17, and TGF‑β—that engage Toll‑like receptor (TLR) signaling in resident macrophages and dendritic cells. Activation of TLR4 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released from gut translocation induces NF‑κB‑dependent transcription of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP‑9, MMP‑14), which degrade tight‑junction proteins (occludin, claudin‑3) in the intestinal epithelium, facilitating a “leaky gut” phenotype. The resulting endotoxemia chronically activates systemic monocytes, skewing the peripheral T‑cell profile toward a Th17/Th1 dominance while suppressing regulatory T‑cell (Treg) expansion. To what extent does the cytokine‑rich peritoneal fluid amplify gut barrier permeability and systemic immune activation in women with endometriosis?
