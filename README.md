# Endometriosis Research Project

This repository contains experimental work using AI tools to research, analyze, and document endometriosis and related immunological and physiological mechanisms.

## Ongoing Work

### Session 3 (`session3/`)
Currently active research attempting scientific writing with references, structured as an academic essay exploring the pathophysiological cascade from endometriosis to chronic fatigue syndrome. The work traces the mechanistic pathway: endometriosis → SIBO development → chronic inflammation → thyroid/HPA axis dysfunction → chronic fatigue. Each chapter section includes detailed biochemical pathways and references supporting evidence stored in JSON files, covering topics from ectopic endometrial tissue implantation and inflammatory cascade initiation, through gut barrier dysfunction and systemic immune dysregulation, to metabolic rate suppression and neuroinflammatory consequences. The research culminates in integrated treatment approaches and emerging therapeutic targets, representing an attempt at rigorous scientific documentation with structured evidence backing.

#### Methodology

The session 3 research follows a structured three-step approach:

1. **Structure Definition**: Establish the main structure that summarizes what we want to write about, creating the foundational framework for the academic essay exploring the endometriosis → SIBO → chronic fatigue pathway.

2. **Plan Development**: Request Zencoder to prepare a detailed plan with chapters, sections, and one paragraph description per section, ensuring systematic coverage of the pathophysiological cascade from endometrial tissue implantation through systemic dysfunction.

3. **Affirmation Generation**: Generate key affirmations for each paragraph, providing specific, evidence-based statements that support the mechanistic relationships and biochemical pathways documented in the research.

4. **Counterpoint Analysis**: For each affirmation, generate an opposite affirmation that challenges or contradicts the primary claim, establishing a dialectical framework to examine alternative perspectives and potential weaknesses in the proposed mechanistic pathways.

5. **Evidence Collection**: For each affirmation and its corresponding opposite affirmation, conduct online searches to identify three references that support each position, ensuring both sides of the scientific debate are adequately documented with peer-reviewed evidence.

6. **Work Summary Generation**: Generate a long paragraph that synthesizes and summarizes the entire work that is going to be written, providing a cohesive overview of the research scope, methodological approach, key findings, and expected contributions to understanding the endometriosis-SIBO-chronic fatigue connection.

7. **Contextual Integration**: For each affirmation, generate three paragraphs that detail how the affirmation fits within the global work, using the previously generated summary paragraph as a reference framework to establish connections, positioning, and relevance within the broader research narrative.

8. **Reference Validation**: For each of the collected references (both affirmation and opposite affirmation), examine the resource to verify if the content supports or contradicts what is stated in the contextual integration, ensuring accuracy and consistency between the evidence base and the research narrative.

9. **Evidence Assessment Summary**: For each affirmation, summarize what aspects of the contextual integration were substantiated by references, contradicted by the evidence, or remain without adequate supporting documentation, providing a clear evaluation of the strength and gaps in the evidence base.

10. **Revised Integration with Citations**: For each affirmation, write a revised contextual integration that aligns with the collected references, incorporating contextual citations and adjusting claims based on the evidence validation to ensure accuracy and scholarly rigor.

11. **Section Content Generation**: Generate the actual section contents according to the initial plan developed in step 2, producing the final academic work exploring the endometriosis → SIBO → chronic fatigue pathway.

12. **Content-Integration Mapping**: For each of the generated paragraphs in step 11, identify the paragraphs from step 10 that are relevant, establishing connections between the section content and the validated contextual integrations with citations.

13. **Content Validation and Citation Integration**: Using the mapping from step 12, for each generated paragraph, reference the corresponding affirmation files (which contain steps 6-10) to check the generated content for correctness and integrate suitable references, ensuring the final academic work maintains accuracy and proper scholarly citation.

## Previous Work

### Zen (`zen/`)

The zen folder contains scientific documentation of the immune system developed using Zencoder, with particular focus on individual immune cell types and their roles in endometriosis pathophysiology. This work produced systematic analyses of major immune cell populations including T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, mast cells, innate lymphoid cells, plasma cells, and memory B cells. Each cell type receives thorough examination covering origins and development, biochemical triggers for creation and destruction, functional characteristics, antigen recognition mechanisms, cellular interactions, metabolic requirements, tissue distribution, pathological roles, and therapeutic targeting approaches. The documentation also explores molecular mechanisms underlying immune cell behavior, including gradient sensing, immune tolerance encoding, monocyte tissue migration patterns, and neutrophil rapid response systems. This work provides immune system documentation that can inform understanding of immune dysregulation in endometriosis and related inflammatory conditions.

### Session 2 (`session2/`)

Also using the gpt-oss:20b model, Session 2 developed a biochemical pathway analysis exploring the interconnected relationships between endometriosis, Small-Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), inflammation, immunity, and thyroid dysregulation, establishing the "gut–endometrium–thyroid" axis as a unified pathogenic framework with detailed molecular mechanisms, biomarkers, and clinical implications.

### Ollama (`ollama/`)

Using the gpt-oss:20b model, this work developed a mechanistic causality analysis exploring the directional relationships between endometriosis, SIBO, chronic fatigue, thyroid/cortisol dysfunction, immune system dysregulation, and gluten allergies. The research produced highly technical mechanistic paragraphs with research questions and culminated in a pairwise causality matrix determining which conditions drive others versus those that are independent or co-occurring.

### Initial Work (`truc.md`)

Initial information gathering about endometriosis from English and French sources.

Contains research covering morphological classification of endometriotic lesions (red, brown, and white types representing different disease stages), post-menopausal endometriosis epidemiology and pathophysiology, progestative treatment options, and malignant transformation risks. The document includes scientific references and covers topics from basic lesion characteristics to hormonal mechanisms and treatment considerations for post-menopausal patients.

# Banned words, expressions and phrasings

These words and expressions are prohibited to maintain the quality and precision of our research documentation. Banned terms typically fall into four categories: **Overused in AI-generated content** - words like "comprehensive" have become hallmarks of generic AI writing, appearing frequently in phrases that add no meaningful value. **Low semantic value** - these terms are vague and fail to specify what makes content thorough or complete, offering no concrete information to readers. **Research precision requirements** - scientific writing about endometriosis, immune mechanisms, and molecular pathways demands specific and precise language rather than generic descriptors. **Content quality control** - by eliminating overused AI terms, we ensure our documentation remains focused, authoritative, and human-like rather than artificially verbose.
