**MAPK (Mitogen‑Activated Protein Kinase)**  
MAPK refers to a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that transduce extracellular signals into diverse cellular responses. They are central to pathways governing proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress responses across eukaryotes. Dysregulation of MAPK signaling is implicated in many human diseases, notably cancers and inflammatory disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins; activated MAPKs shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus.  
- Expressed ubiquitously, with higher abundance in rapidly dividing tissues such as skin, gut epithelium, and immune cells.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Family: MAPK (Ser/Thr kinase).  
- Subfamilies: ERK1/2 (`MAPK3/1`), ERK5 (`MAPK7`), p38 (`MAPK14`, `MAPK11/12/13`), JNK (`MAPK8/9/10`).  
- Key motifs: ATP‑binding P‑loop, activation loop containing conserved TEY/TDY residues, and C‑terminal kinase domain.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Transduce signals from receptor tyrosine kinases, G‑protein coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, and integrins.  
- Activate transcription factors (e.g., `ELK1`, `AP-1`, `CREB`) to modulate gene expression for cell cycle, differentiation, and survival.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing generates isoforms (e.g., ERK1 vs. ERK2).  
- Post‑translational modifications: dual phosphorylation on the activation loop, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation influence stability and localization.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Activation requires dual phosphorylation by upstream MAPKKs (`MEK1/2`, `MKK3/6`, `MKK4/7`).  
- Dephosphorylation by MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) terminates signaling.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Receptors: RTKs (EGFR, VEGFR), GPCRs (β‑adrenergic), cytokine receptors (IL‑6).  
- Cascade: MAPKKK (e.g., `RAF`, `TAK1`) → MAPKK → MAPK → downstream substrates.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Neuronal**: ERK1/2 in synaptic plasticity; p38/JNK in neurodegeneration.  
- **Immune**: p38 in cytokine production; ERK in T‑cell activation.  
- **Cardiovascular**: ERK1/2 promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; p38 contributes to ischemic injury.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Binds scaffold proteins (`KSR1`, `JIP1`) to enhance signal specificity.  
- Cross‑talk with PI3K/AKT, NF‑κB, and mTOR pathways.  
- Modulates cytoskeletal dynamics via phosphorylation of `cortactin`, `filamin`.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Somatic mutations in `KRAS`, `BRAF`, `MAP2K1` activate MAPK in cancers.  
- Germline SNPs in `MAPK3` linked to autoimmune diseases and psychiatric disorders.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Oxidative stress** and UV exposure activate p38/JNK.  
- **Polyphenols** (curcumin, resveratrol) inhibit MAPK activation.  
- **Exercise** transiently stimulates ERK1/2 in skeletal muscle.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Cancer**: Constitutive MAPK signaling drives uncontrolled proliferation.  
- **Cardiovascular disease**: p38/JNK mediate inflammatory responses in atherosclerosis.  
- **Neurodegeneration**: Chronic JNK/p38 activation contributes to protein aggregation.  
- **Inflammatory disorders**: p38 is a key regulator of pro‑inflammatory cytokine synthesis.

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance
- **Inhibitors**: MEK inhibitors (`trametinib`, `selumetinib`), ERK inhibitors (`ulixertinib`), p38 inhibitors (`doramapimod`).  
- **Biomarker**: Phosphorylated MAPK levels serve as pharmacodynamic readouts in clinical trials.
