**Inhibin‑β** is a member of the TGF‑β superfamily that functions primarily as a hormone regulating gonadotropin secretion.  It is produced by ovarian granulosa cells and testicular Sertoli cells as a heterodimer of an α‑subunit (encoded by `INHA`) and a β‑subunit (encoded by `INHBB`).  Inhibin‑β exerts its main effect by inhibiting follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH) release from the anterior pituitary.  

## 2. Location & Context
- Secreted into the bloodstream from ovarian granulosa cells (female) and testicular Sertoli cells (male).  
- Concentrations range from ~10–30 ng/mL in circulating serum; localized in the follicular fluid and seminiferous tubules.  

## 3. Classification & Structure
- **Family:** TGF‑β superfamily; part of the inhibin/activin sub‑family.  
- **Structure:** Non‑covalently linked heterodimer of `INHA` (α‑subunit) and `INHBB` (β‑subunit) with a cystine‑knotted core.  

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Primary role: negative feedback inhibitor of pituitary FSH secretion.  
- Modulates follicular development, spermatogenesis, and steroidogenesis.  

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Alternative splicing of `INHBB` yields the βA and βB isoforms (`INHBB`/`INHBA`).  
- Glycosylation at N‑glycosylation sites on the β‑subunit is essential for secretion and activity.  

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Synthesized as a pro‑protein, processed by pro‑protein convertases (e.g., furin) to mature hormone.  
- Degraded primarily by proteolytic enzymes in the extracellular matrix; clearance occurs via the liver and kidneys.  

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Binds to activin type II receptors (`ACVR2A`, `ACVR2B`) in complex with the co‑receptor betaglycan (`TGFBR3`).  
- Inhibits SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, thereby reducing transcription of FSH‑β subunit genes.  

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Ovary:** Suppresses FSH to limit excessive follicular growth; modulates estradiol production.  
- **Testis:** Limits FSH‑mediated Sertoli cell proliferation and spermatogenesis.  

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Competes with activin for receptor binding, acting as an antagonist.  
- Inhibited by follistatin and follistatin‑like proteins, which sequester active inhibin‑β.  
- Synergistic regulation with anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).  

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNPs in `INHBB` (e.g., rs1049003) associated with altered FSH levels and ovarian reserve.  
- Copy‑number variations involving `INHBA`/`INHBB` linked to reproductive disorders.  

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Nutritional status (e.g., protein intake) can modulate inhibin‑β levels; caloric restriction lowers serum concentrations.  
- Exposure to endocrine‑disrupting chemicals (e.g., bisphenol A) may alter `INHBB` expression.  

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Infertility:** Low inhibin‑β correlates with diminished ovarian reserve and poor response to ovarian stimulation.  
- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):** Dysregulated inhibin‑β contributes to hyper‑FSH and hyperandrogenemia.  
- **Certain cancers:** Overexpression in breast, ovarian, and testicular tumors; potential biomarker for disease progression.  
- **Bone disorders:** Inhibin‑β may influence bone remodeling through interaction with osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
