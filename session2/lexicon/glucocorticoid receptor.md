The **glucocorticoid receptor** (GR, encoded by the *NR3C1* gene) is a ligand‑dependent transcription factor that mediates the cellular effects of glucocorticoid hormones such as cortisol and synthetic analogues.  GR is ubiquitously expressed and serves as a key regulator of stress responses, inflammation, metabolism, and immune tolerance.

## 2. Location & Context
- Cytoplasm (unliganded), nucleus (liganded) in most cell types.  
- Expressed in brain, adrenal gland, immune cells, liver, muscle, and adipose tissue; abundance ranges from low (neurons) to high (immune cells).

## 3. Classification & Structure
- Nuclear receptor superfamily, subfamily GR.  
- Five domains: A/B (transactivation), DNA‑binding domain (DBD) with two zinc‑finger motifs, hinge region, ligand‑binding domain (LBD), and C‑terminal activation function‑2 (AF‑2).

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Transcriptional activation or repression of genes involved in glucose metabolism, lipid mobilization, anti‑inflammatory signaling, and apoptosis.  
- Modulates cytokine production, immune cell trafficking, and vascular permeability.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing yields GRα (active) and GRβ (dominant‑negative).  
- Post‑translational modifications: phosphorylation (Ser‑211, Ser‑226), ubiquitination, SUMOylation, acetylation.

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Endogenous ligand cortisol synthesized from cholesterol via adrenal steroidogenesis.  
- Synthetic glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone) are metabolized by hepatic 11β‑hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds glucocorticoids in the cytoplasm; ligand‑bound complex translocates to the nucleus.  
- Genomic action via GRE (glucocorticoid response element) binding; non‑genomic actions involve kinase cascades (MAPK, PI3K/Akt) and membrane‑associated GR isoforms.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Immune system**: suppresses pro‑inflammatory cytokines (IL‑1β, TNF‑α).  
- **Metabolic tissues**: promotes gluconeogenesis in liver, lipolysis in adipose tissue.  
- **Neuroendocrine**: modulates HPA axis feedback; influences neuronal plasticity.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cross‑talk with NF‑κB, AP‑1, and STAT transcription factors.  
- Co‑activators (SRC‑1, CBP/p300) and co‑repressors (NCoR, SMRT) modulate transcriptional outcomes.  
- Interacts with the HSP90‑chaperone complex for proper folding.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in *NR3C1* promoter (e.g., BclI, ER22/23EK) affect glucocorticoid sensitivity.  
- Mutations causing GR‑deficient adrenal hyperplasia or glucocorticoid resistance.  
- Copy‑number variations associated with altered steroid response.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, and high‑salt diet increase endogenous glucocorticoid exposure.  
- Certain foods (e.g., polyphenols) can modulate GR signaling pathways.  
- Exposure to environmental toxins (e.g., endocrine disruptors) may interfere with GR function.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Chronic inflammation**: impaired GR signaling contributes to autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis).  
- **Metabolic syndrome**: dysregulated GR activity leads to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.  
- **Glucocorticoid‑resistance**: reduces efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in asthma, COPD, and inflammatory bowel disease.  
- **Neuropsychiatric disorders**: altered GR signaling implicated in depression and PTSD.

**Therapeutic relevance**  
Glucocorticoid receptor agonists (e.g., prednisone) and antagonists (e.g., mifepristone) are central to the treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune, and certain endocrine disorders.  Modulators of GR splice variants and post‑translational modifications represent emerging therapeutic strategies.
