**STAT3** (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that mediates cytokine‑ and growth‑factor–driven gene expression. It rapidly translocates to the nucleus upon phosphorylation and regulates cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and immune responses. Dysregulated STAT3 signaling is a hallmark of many cancers and inflammatory disorders.

## 2. Location & Context
- Cytoplasmic protein that shuttles to the nucleus after activation.  
- Highest expression in immune cells (T cells, macrophages), hepatocytes, and epithelial cells; ubiquitous across tissues.

## 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the STAT family; contains N‑terminal, coiled‑coil, DNA‑binding, linker, SH2, and C‑terminal transactivation domains.  
- Critical motifs: Tyr705 (phosphorylation site) and Ser727 (modulator of transcriptional activity).

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Transduces signals from IL‑6, IL‑10, EGF, HGF, and other cytokine/growth‑factor receptors via JAK kinases.  
- Induces transcription of anti‑apoptotic (BCL‑XL), cell‑cycle (cyclin D1), and angiogenic (VEGF) genes.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Two splice variants: `STAT3α` (full length) and `STAT3β` (C‑terminal truncation).  
- Post‑translational modifications: Tyr705 phosphorylation, Ser727 phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- SH2 domain binds phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated receptors; recruited to JAK kinases for phosphorylation.  
- Phosphorylated STAT3 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds GAS elements to drive transcription.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Immune system:** drives Th17 differentiation, IL‑17 production, and cytokine secretion.  
- **Liver:** promotes hepatocyte regeneration; in tumors, facilitates tumor‑associated macrophage recruitment.  
- **Cancer:** sustains proliferation and survival of tumor cells in breast, lung, colorectal, and hematologic malignancies.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Crosstalk with `STAT1`, `STAT5`, NF‑κB, and AP‑1.  
- Interacts with phosphotyrosine‑containing peptides and regulatory proteins such as PIAS for negative feedback.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Gain‑of‑function mutations (e.g., V617F, R609) associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms.  
- Promoter SNPs (rs744166) influence transcriptional activity and disease susceptibility.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Polyphenols (curcumin, resveratrol, EGCG) inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation.  
- Environmental factors such as hyperoxia and tobacco smoke enhance STAT3 activation in airway epithelium.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Constitutive activation in solid tumors and hematologic cancers; target for therapeutic inhibition.  
- Implicated in inflammatory diseases: psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease.  
- **Biomarker:** phosphorylated `STAT3` (Tyr705) detected in tumor biopsies and circulating tumor cells.

### Therapeutic Relevance
- Small‑molecule inhibitors (e.g., ruxolitinib, napabucasin) target JAK‑STAT3 signaling.  
- Peptide inhibitors (e.g., STA‑21) and antisense oligonucleotides reduce STAT3 activity in preclinical models.  
- Clinical trials are ongoing for cancers with high p‑STAT3 expression and for inflammatory conditions where STAT3 blockade may ameliorate pathology.
