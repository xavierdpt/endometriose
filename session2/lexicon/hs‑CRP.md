**hs‑CRP** is a pentameric acute‑phase protein synthesized primarily by hepatocytes in response to pro‑inflammatory cytokines. It circulates in the plasma and serves as a sensitive marker of systemic inflammation, particularly useful in cardiovascular risk assessment.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Plasma protein, normally 0.1–1 mg/L in healthy adults.  
- Also detected in interstitial fluids of inflamed tissues.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Member of the C‑reactive protein (CRP) family of pattern‑recognition proteins.  
- Pentameric, each subunit (~23 kDa) contains a conserved β‑barrel and an N‑terminal α‑helix.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Binds phosphocholine on damaged cells, opsonizing them for phagocytosis.  
- Activates complement component C1q, initiating the classical pathway.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Alternative quaternary forms: monomeric CRP (mCRP) generated by dissociation, which exhibits distinct pro‑inflammatory activities.  
- Minor post‑translational modifications: N‑glycosylation at Asn‑107.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Synthesized in the liver via the acute‑phase response; transcriptionally up‑regulated by IL‑6, IL‑1β, and TNF‑α.  
- Catabolized by reticuloendothelial cells and renal excretion.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Binds to CRP receptors such as FcγRIIa on macrophages, triggering NF‑κB activation.  
- Interacts with complement component C1q, leading to cascade propagation.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- In arterial wall, binds oxidized LDL and facilitates macrophage recruitment.  
- In kidney, high concentrations can contribute to glomerular inflammation.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Forms complexes with HDL, influencing cholesterol efflux.  
- Modulates endothelial adhesion molecule expression via NF‑κB.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- rs1205 (A allele) associated with lower hs‑CRP levels; rs1130864 influences inflammatory response.  
- No known pathogenic mutations; common variants modulate baseline and stimulated concentrations.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Elevated by smoking, obesity, and high‑fat diets.  
- Reduced by omega‑3 fatty acids, weight loss, and anti‑inflammatory diets.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Elevated hs‑CRP predicts myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.  
- Associated with autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and metabolic syndrome.

### Clinical Biomarker / Diagnostic Tests  
- **High‑sensitivity CRP (hs‑CRP)** assay (immunonephelometry or ELISA) measures concentrations <10 mg/L, used to stratify cardiovascular risk per ACC/AHA guidelines.

### Therapeutic Relevance  
- Target of anti‑inflammatory therapies (e.g., colchicine, canakinumab) in cardiovascular disease trials; reduction correlates with event risk mitigation.
