**T4 (thyroxine)**  
Thyroxine (T4) is a thyroid‑derived hormone composed of a single tyrosine residue substituted with four iodine atoms. It circulates in the bloodstream largely bound to carrier proteins, and is converted to the more biologically active form, triiodothyronine (T3), in peripheral tissues. T4 regulates basal metabolic rate, growth, and differentiation across virtually all organ systems.  

### 2. Location & Context
- Synthesized in the follicular cells of the thyroid gland.  
- Secreted into the bloodstream; ~80 % bound to thyroxine‑binding globulin (TBG), ~20 % to transthyretin, and a small fraction is free.  
- Active in peripheral tissues where deiodinase enzymes convert it to T3.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the iodothyronine hormone family.  
- Structure: a phenolic ring with four iodine atoms (I) and an amino acid backbone of tyrosine.  
- Chemical formula: \( \mathrm{C}_{15}\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{I}_4\mathrm{NO}_4 \).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Primarily elevates basal metabolic rate by increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.  
- Modulates gene transcription via nuclear T3 receptors (TRα, TRβ) after conversion to T3.  
- Influences cardiovascular function, neurodevelopment, and bone remodeling.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **T3** (\( \mathrm{I}_3 \))—the active metabolite produced by deiodination of T4.  
- **Reverse T3** (rT3)—inactive isomer formed from peripheral deiodination.  
- Post‑translational modifications: iodination (mono‑, di‑, tri‑, or tetra‑) during synthesis.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized via iodide uptake, organification by thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and coupling reactions.  
- Stored in the colloid as thyroglobulin (Tg)–T4 complexes; released upon proteolytic cleavage.  
- Peripheral conversion: Type I, II, and III deiodinases mediate iodide removal.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Converted to T3, which binds nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs).  
- TRs heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and bind thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) to regulate transcription.  
- Non‑genomic actions via integrin αvβ3 and activation of MAPK/PI3K pathways.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Cardiovascular**: increases heart rate and contractility.  
- **Central nervous system**: promotes myelination and synaptic plasticity.  
- **Skeletal**: balances osteoblast/osteoclast activity.  
- **Adipose**: stimulates lipolysis and thermogenesis.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Binds to thyroid hormone–binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin, and albumin.  
- Modulated by iodine availability, selenium (for deiodinases), and copper (for TPO).  
- Cross‑talk with cortisol, insulin, and growth hormone pathways.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- **THRβ1/2** polymorphisms can alter tissue sensitivity.  
- Variants in the deiodinase genes (DIO1, DIO2, DIO3) influence conversion rates.  
- Polymorphisms in the TBG gene affect serum binding capacity.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Adequate dietary iodine is essential; deficiency leads to decreased T4 synthesis.  
- Selenium and zinc intake support deiodinase activity.  
- Exposure to goitrogens (e.g., thiocyanate, perchlorate) can inhibit iodide uptake.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Hypothyroidism**: low T4/T3 levels → fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance.  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: elevated T4/T3 → tachycardia, heat intolerance, osteoporosis.  
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: high TSH with normal T4; risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  
- **Thyroiditis**: transient thyrotoxic phase followed by hypothyroidism.

### Clinical Biomarkers & Diagnostic Tests
- Serum free T4 (fT4) and total T4 assays.  
- TSH measurement is the primary screening test; fT4 confirms peripheral hormone status.  

### Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- Synthetic levothyroxine (T4) is the first‑line treatment for hypothyroidism.  
- Monitoring T4 levels guides dose adjustments.  
- Antithyroid drugs (propylthiouracil, methimazole) inhibit TPO, reducing T4 synthesis.
