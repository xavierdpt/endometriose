DIO1 and DIO2 are selenocysteine‑containing iodothyronine deiodinases that catalyze the activation and deactivation of thyroid hormones by removing an outer iodine atom from thyroxine (T4) to produce triiodothyronine (T3) or reverse‑T3 (rT3). These enzymes are crucial for local regulation of thyroid hormone availability in peripheral tissues and the brain, thereby modulating metabolic rate, growth, and neurodevelopment. Their activity is tightly controlled by selenium status, hormonal signals, and genetic variation.

## 2. Location & Context
- **Cellular compartments:** `DIO1` is predominantly ER‑membrane‑bound but also found in lysosomal vesicles; `DIO2` is ER‑bound and associated with mitochondria‑containing vesicles.  
- **Tissue distribution:**  
  - `DIO1`: liver, kidney, thyroid follicular cells, placenta.  
  - `DIO2`: brain (hypothalamus, pituitary), brown adipose tissue, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, osteoblasts.  
- **Abundance:** `DIO1` expresses at high levels in liver (~10 µg mg⁻¹ protein), whereas `DIO2` is expressed at lower levels (~0.5–1 µg mg⁻¹) but is critical in tissues with high metabolic demands.

## 3. Classification & Structure
- **Family:** iodothyronine deiodinase (selenoprotein) family.  
- **Key features:**  
  - Single polypeptide (~120 kDa).  
  - Contains a conserved selenocysteine (`U`) at the active site (Cys‑Ser‑Gly‑U).  
  - Requires a selenophosphate–selenocysteine synthase pathway for incorporation of `U`.  
  - Substrate‑binding pocket accommodates the iodine atoms of T4/T3.

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- `DIO1`: primarily responsible for converting circulating T4 to T3 and producing rT3; contributes to the systemic availability of T3.  
- `DIO2`: provides tissue‑specific T3 generation, especially in the central nervous system, where it regulates neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and thyroid hormone–dependent transcription.  
- Both enzymes also inactivate T3 by converting it to T2, thereby fine‑tuning hormone action.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **Isoforms:** `DIO1` and `DIO2` are distinct genes; splice variants are not well characterized.  
- **Post‑translational modifications:** glycosylation, phosphorylation at Ser/Thr residues modulate enzyme stability and localization.

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- **Biosynthesis:** Translation in the rough ER, insertion of `U` at UGA codon via SECIS element and selenocysteine‑specific tRNA^Sec.  
- **Degradation:** Proteasomal degradation after ubiquitination; lysosomal turnover for `DIO1`.  
- **Co‑factor requirement:** Selenium (as selenophosphate) is essential; deficiency leads to reduced activity.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- `DIO1` and `DIO2` do not bind nuclear receptors directly; they generate T3 that activates thyroid hormone receptors (`TRα` and `TRβ`) in the nucleus, initiating transcriptional programs.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Brain:** `DIO2` ensures adequate T3 for myelination and cognitive function; deficiency causes reversible cognitive deficits.  
- **Brown adipose tissue:** `DIO2` stimulates thermogenesis via UCP1 induction.  
- **Cardiac muscle:** `DIO2` modulates heart rate and contractility by maintaining intracellular T3 levels.  
- **Bone:** Both enzymes influence osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH):** Up‑regulates `DIO1` transcription in the thyroid gland.  
- **Selenoprotein synthesis machinery:** `DIO1`/`DIO2` rely on `SecS` and `SEPSECS` enzymes for `U` incorporation.  
- **Hormone‑binding globulins:** `DIO1` can deiodinate T4 bound to thyroxine‑binding globulin (TBG) in plasma.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- **`DIO2` Thr92Ala (rs225014):** Associated with altered enzymatic activity and increased risk of obesity, impaired thermogenesis, and altered depression susceptibility.  
- **`DIO1` variants (e.g., rs112894730):** Linked to altered serum T3/T4 ratios and cardiovascular disease risk.  
- **Copy‑number variations** in the `DIO1` locus can lead to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism phenotypes.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Selenium intake:** Determines `DIO1`/`DIO2` activity; deficiency leads to decreased T3 production and increased rT3.  
- **Goitrogens (e.g., iodine‑deficient diets, certain cruciferous vegetables):** Can inhibit deiodinase activity indirectly through thyroid hormone level alterations.  
- **Environmental toxins (e.g., perchlorate, thiocyanate):** May interfere with iodine uptake, thereby affecting substrate availability for deiodinases.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Hypothyroidism:** Reduced `DIO1` activity due to selenium deficiency or genetic mutations leads to low T3.  
- **Hashimoto’s thyroiditis:** Autoimmune attack can damage `DIO1`‑expressing thyroid cells.  
- **Non‑thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS):** Critical illness induces down‑regulation of `DIO1`/`DIO2`, reducing peripheral T3 production.  
- **Metabolic syndrome:** `DIO2` Thr92Ala variant correlates with insulin resistance and obesity.  
- **Cardiovascular disease:** Altered deiodinase activity influences cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenesis.
