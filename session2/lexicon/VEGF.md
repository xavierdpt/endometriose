**VEGF**  
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key angiogenic cytokine that promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and vascular permeability. It drives the growth of new blood vessels during development, wound healing, and physiological processes such as the menstrual cycle. Dysregulated VEGF signaling underlies many pathologies involving aberrant angiogenesis.

### 1. Introductory Summary  
VEGF is a secreted protein family that orchestrates endothelial cell behavior and neovascularization. It is essential for embryonic vasculogenesis, post‑natal angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Secreted into the extracellular matrix and bloodstream by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and tumor cells.  
- Localized concentrations range from nanomolar in normal tissue to micromolar in tumor microenvironments.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Family: FGF-related superfamily; 5 members (`VEGF-A`, `VEGF-B`, `VEGF-C`, `VEGF-D`, `PlGF`).  
- Core domain: ~45 kDa glycoprotein with a fibronectin type III fold and a heparin‑binding region.  
- Isoforms arise from alternative splicing and proteolytic processing (e.g., `VEGF_165`, `VEGF_121`, `VEGF_145`).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Binds endothelial tyrosine‑kinase receptors `VEGFR-1` (Flt-1) and `VEGFR-2` (KDR/Flk-1).  
- Activation of `VEGFR-2` triggers PI3K–AKT, PLCγ–PKC, and MAPK pathways, leading to angiogenic gene expression.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Alternately spliced variants (e.g., `VEGF_165`, `VEGF_121`).  
- Proteolytic cleavage can generate pro‑angiogenic or anti‑angiogenic fragments.  
- Glycosylation at N‑glycosylation sites influences dimerization and receptor affinity.

### 6. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- `VEGFR-2`: primary signaling receptor; homodimerization upon ligand binding.  
- `VEGFR-1`: acts as a decoy or modulator; has weaker kinase activity.  
- Co‑receptor `Nrp-1` (neuropilin‑1) potentiates signaling by presenting VEGF to `VEGFR-2`.

### 7. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Endothelium:** promotes sprouting, migration, and barrier modulation.  
- **Pericytes & smooth muscle cells:** supports mural cell recruitment and vessel maturation.  
- **Tumor stroma:** enhances neo‑vascularization, facilitating metastasis.  
- **Neural tissues:** involved in blood‑brain barrier development.

### 8. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- **Heparan sulfate proteoglycans:** stabilize VEGF–receptor complexes.  
- **Integrins (`αvβ3`, `αvβ5`):** collaborate in migration signaling.  
- **Angiopoietins:** coordinate vascular stability and maturation.

### 9. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNPs in the `VEGFA` promoter (e.g., `-2578C > A`) affect transcriptional activity.  
- `VEGFA_+936C > T` associated with altered serum VEGF levels and disease susceptibility.  
- Rare coding mutations cause familial exudative polymicrophthalmia (FEVM).

### 10. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Cancer:** overexpression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.  
- **Diabetic retinopathy & macular edema:** choroidal/vessel leakage driven by VEGF.  
- **Rheumatoid arthritis:** VEGF promotes pannus vascularization and inflammation.  
- **Impaired wound healing:** deficiency leads to ischemic tissue damage.

### 11. Therapeutic Relevance  
- Anti‑VEGF agents (`bevacizumab`, `ranibizumab`, `aflibercept`) block ligand–receptor interaction in oncology and ophthalmology.  
- Over‑inhibition can cause hypertension, thrombosis, and impaired regeneration.
