**Susceptibility to Autoimmunity**  
Autoimmunity arises when the immune system misrecognizes self‑antigens, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage.  Genetic, environmental, and immunological factors converge to create a “susceptibility” phenotype that predisposes individuals to a spectrum of autoimmune diseases.  Understanding this trait informs risk assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted therapies.

### 2. Location & Context
- Present in individuals across all populations; expressed as a heritable or acquired risk factor.  
- Not a discrete cellular or tissue entity, but a systemic predisposition affecting the immune system at large.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Classified as a **polygenic risk factor**; no single “structure” exists, but it involves coordinated variation in immune‑regulatory genes.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Modulates tolerance checkpoints, cytokine production, and antigen presentation.  
- Enhances propensity for autoreactive B and T cell escape from central and peripheral tolerance.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Not applicable (no defined molecular derivative).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Not applicable.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Not applicable as a standalone entity; however, susceptibility genes encode components of signaling pathways (e.g., CTLA4, CD40L).

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Influences all immune‑active tissues; tissue‑specific expression of susceptibility genes (e.g., HLA‑DRB1 in thymus, gut‑associated lymphoid tissue).

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Interacts with cytokines (IL‑2, IFN‑γ), co‑stimulatory molecules (CD28, CD40), and regulatory pathways (TGF‑β).  
- Modulated by microbial metabolites (SCFAs) and vitamin D levels.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
| Gene | Variant | Disease Link |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `HLA‑DRB1` | *shared epitope* alleles (e.g., *DRB1*04:01) | RA, SLE |
| `CTLA4` | +49A>G (rs231775) | RA, type 1 diabetes |
| `PTPN22` | C1858T (rs2476601) | RA, T1D, APS |
| `IL2RA` | rs2104286 | T1D, MS |
| `STAT4` | rs7574865 | RA, SLE |
| `TNFAIP3` | various loss‑of‑function mutations | AITD, psoriasis |

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Infections** (e.g., Epstein–Barr virus) trigger molecular mimicry.  
- **Gut microbiome** composition (e.g., reduced *Akkermansia muciniphila*) correlates with risk.  
- **Smoking** upregulates HLA‑DR expression on macrophages.  
- **Vitamin D deficiency** impairs Treg function.  
- **Stress hormones** (cortisol) modulate cytokine milieu.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Rheumatoid arthritis** (RA) – *HLA‑DRB1* shared epitope.  
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus** (SLE) – CTLA4, STAT4, HLA‑DRB1.  
- **Type 1 diabetes** (T1D) – PTPN22, IL2RA.  
- **Multiple sclerosis** (MS) – HLA‑DRB1, IL2RA.  
- **Autoimmune thyroid disease** (AITD) – TNFAIP3, HLA‑DR.  
- **Inflammatory bowel disease** (IBD) – NOD2, IL23R.  
- **Psoriasis** – HLA‑C*06:02, TNFAIP3.  

### Optional Sections

#### Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- **HLA typing** for shared epitope alleles.  
- **Serum autoantibodies** (e.g., anti‑CCP, anti‑dsDNA).  
- **Genetic risk scores** integrating multiple SNPs.  

#### Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- **CTLA4-Ig** (abatacept) to modulate T‑cell costimulation.  
- **TNF‑α inhibitors** (adalimumab, infliximab) for multiple autoimmune phenotypes.  
- **JAK inhibitors** (tofacitinib) targeting cytokine signaling.  
- **Vitamin D supplementation** and microbiome modulation as adjunctive strategies.
