**Interleukin‑6 (IL‑6)**  
IL‑6 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. It mediates acute‑phase responses, B‑cell differentiation, and hepatocyte stimulation, making it a central regulator of inflammation and metabolism.

### 1. Introductory Summary  
IL‑6 is a secreted glycoprotein that orchestrates immune, inflammatory, and metabolic responses. It functions as both a classic cytokine and a trans‑cytokine through soluble IL‑6 receptor interactions. Elevated IL‑6 levels are a hallmark of numerous inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Synthesized and secreted by macrophages, T cells, adipocytes, and hepatocytes.  
- Acts in the extracellular space; signals in autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine manners.  
- Serum concentrations range from <5 pg mL⁻¹ (basal) to >1000 pg mL⁻¹ (sepsis).

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Family: IL‑6 subfamily of the four‑α‑helical bundle cytokines.  
- Single‑chain, ~180 aa, N‑terminal signal peptide followed by two helical domains.  
- Glycosylated at Asn‑138 and Asn‑179 (human).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Drives acute‑phase protein synthesis in hepatocytes (CRP, fibrinogen).  
- Promotes B‑cell differentiation into plasma cells.  
- Regulates T‑cell fate, favoring Th17 over Treg differentiation.  
- Modulates metabolic pathways, including lipolysis and insulin resistance.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- No classical splice variants; however, soluble IL‑6 receptor (sIL‑6R) circulates after ectodomain shedding.  
- Post‑translational modifications: N‑glycosylation, tyrosine phosphorylation (during signaling).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Synthesized on rough ER, secreted via constitutive exocytosis.  
- Clearance mediated by IL‑6/IL‑6R/gp130 complex internalization and lysosomal degradation.  
- Serum IL‑6 has a short half‑life (~2 h) but can be sustained by persistent production.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **Receptors**: membrane IL‑6Rα (CD126) + signal‑transducing gp130 (CD130).  
- **Trans‑cytokine pathway**: sIL‑6R complexes with IL‑6, activates gp130 on cells lacking IL‑6Rα.  
- **Signal cascades**: JAK1/2 → STAT3 phosphorylation → gene transcription; also MAPK, PI3K/AKT pathways.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Hepatocytes**: induces acute‑phase proteins.  
- **Adipocytes**: promotes lipolysis and insulin resistance.  
- **Neurons**: contributes to sickness behavior and neuroinflammation.  
- **Bone marrow stromal cells**: supports hematopoiesis.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Binds gp130 homodimer, activating shared downstream pathways.  
- Crosstalk with TNF‑α, IL‑1β, and IFN‑γ amplifies inflammatory responses.  
- Modulates TGF‑β signaling by influencing Smad2/3 phosphorylation in fibroblasts.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- **IL6 −174 G > C (rs1800795)**: C allele associated with higher IL‑6 production and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  
- **IL6 + 597 C > T (rs2069835)**: linked to altered cytokine responses in inflammatory bowel disease.  
- Copy‑number variations of IL6R influence systemic IL‑6 signaling intensity.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- High‑fat diets elevate circulating IL‑6 via adipose tissue secretion.  
- Physical activity reduces basal IL‑6 levels (acute exercise increases transiently).  
- Smoking, pollution, and viral infections upregulate IL‑6 expression.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: IL‑6 drives synovial inflammation; serum IL‑6 predicts disease activity.  
- **Sepsis & ARDS**: massive IL‑6 release correlates with organ dysfunction.  
- **Metabolic syndrome**: chronic IL‑6 contributes to insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.  
- **COVID‑19**: hyper‑IL‑6 is a key mediator of cytokine‑release syndrome.  
- **Cancer**: IL‑6 promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion in several malignancies.

#### Clinical Biomarkers  
- Serum IL‑6 measured by ELISA is used to gauge inflammatory status in rheumatologic and critical‑care settings.

#### Therapeutic Relevance  
- **Tocilizumab** (humanized anti‑IL‑6R monoclonal antibody) blocks IL‑6 signaling; approved for rheumatoid arthritis, cytokine‑release syndrome, and COVID‑19.  
- **Sarilumab** and **siltuximab** are additional IL‑6/IL‑6R inhibitors in clinical use.
