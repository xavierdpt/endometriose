**Title: Cortisol‑mediated dampening of TRH release**

Cortisol, the primary glucocorticoid released by the adrenal cortex, exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamic release of thyrotropin‑releasing hormone (TRH). This regulatory mechanism is central to maintaining thyroid‑hormone homeostasis and integrates the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑thyroid (HPT) axis with the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) axis.

### 2. Location & Context
- Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons synthesize and secrete `TRH` into the hypophyseal portal system.
- Cortisol circulates systemically and reaches the PVN via the bloodstream, acting on TRH‑producing neurons.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Cortisol binding to its receptor in TRH neurons suppresses `Trh` gene transcription, reducing `TRH` secretion.
- Decreased `TRH` lowers pituitary `TSH` output, thereby down‑regulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Cortisol enters cells and binds the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor (`GR`, NR3C1), forming a homodimer that translocates to the nucleus.
- The `GR` complex recruits corepressors (e.g., `NCoR`, `SMRT`) and inhibits transcription factors (`CREB`, `Sp1`) that normally drive `Trh` transcription.
- Non‑genomic actions via membrane‑associated `GR` can rapidly modulate ion channel activity and intracellular signaling pathways in TRH neurons.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- The dampening effect is almost exclusively observed in hypothalamic `Trh`‑producing neurons; pituitary thyrotrophs respond indirectly through reduced `TRH` input.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- `Cortisol` up‑regulates `GILZ` and `SGK1`, which influence TRH mRNA stability and neuronal excitability.
- It counteracts stimulatory inputs from `CRH` and sympathetic neurotransmitters, balancing excitatory and inhibitory signals in the PVN.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Single‑nucleotide polymorphisms in `NR3C1` (e.g., `BclI`, `N363S`) modify GR sensitivity, altering the efficiency of cortisol‑mediated TRH suppression.
- Variants in the `Trh` promoter region can influence susceptibility to dysregulation when cortisol signaling is impaired.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Adrenal insufficiency or glucocorticoid resistance leads to elevated TRH and subsequent thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism due to lack of feedback inhibition.
- Chronic stress, which elevates circulating cortisol, can persistently suppress TRH, contributing to subclinical hypothyroidism and metabolic disturbances.
- Dysregulated cortisol‑TRH signaling has been implicated in mood disorders, metabolic syndrome, and impaired stress adaptation.
