**Th2 dominance** refers to a state in which the helper T‑cell response is skewed toward the Th2 phenotype, characterized by the production of IL‑4, IL‑5, IL‑9, IL‑10, and IL‑13. This pattern underlies many atopic diseases and promotes humoral immunity while suppressing Th1‑mediated cellular responses. The balance between Th1 and Th2 is pivotal for immune homeostasis and disease susceptibility.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- **Tissue distribution**: Primarily occurs in secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen) and inflamed mucosal sites (airway, gut).  
- **Cell types involved**: CD4⁺ T helper cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and B cells.  
- **Expression levels**: Elevated cytokine secretion (e.g., IL‑4 > 100 pg/mL) during allergic inflammation.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- **Category**: Adaptive immune response subtype.  
- **Key signaling molecules**: Cytokines IL‑4, IL‑5, IL‑9, IL‑10, IL‑13; transcription factor GATA‑3 drives Th2 differentiation.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- **Humoral immunity**: Stimulates IgE class switching in B cells.  
- **Eosinophil recruitment**: IL‑5 promotes eosinophil maturation and survival.  
- **Mucosal barrier regulation**: IL‑13 induces goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus secretion.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- **Cytokine isoforms**: IL‑4 and IL‑13 share the receptor component **IL4Rα**.  
- **Post‑translational modifications**: Cytokines are glycosylated; IL‑5 undergoes proteolytic maturation.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- **Synthesis**: Transcriptionally induced by STAT6 activation downstream of IL‑4/IL‑13 receptors.  
- **Degradation**: Cytokine clearance via receptor-mediated endocytosis and proteolytic enzymes (e.g., IL‑4Rα shedding).

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **IL‑4 receptor complex**: `IL4Rα` + `γc` → activates JAK1/3 → STAT6 phosphorylation.  
- **IL‑13 receptor complex**: `IL13Rα1` + `IL4Rα` → same downstream STAT6 pathway.  
- **Mode of action**: Transcriptional regulation of Th2‑specific genes; genomic signaling.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Airway**: IL‑13 → airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion.  
- **Gut**: IL‑4/IL‑13 → increased IgA production and mucosal barrier modulation.  
- **Skin**: Th2 cytokines drive eczematous inflammation via keratinocyte activation.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- **Cross‑talk**: IL‑10 inhibits Th1 cytokine production (IFN‑γ).  
- **Regulatory networks**: `STAT6` interacts with `GATA‑3` and `BCL6`.  
- **Complement**: Th2 skewing increases `C3a` production, further activating mast cells.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- **IL4**: `-590C>T` promoter variant correlates with higher IgE levels.  
- **IL13**: `-1112C>T` allele associated with allergic asthma.  
- **GATA3**: Copy‑number variations linked to atopy severity.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- **Microbiome**: Short‑chain fatty acids (butyrate) suppress Th2 differentiation.  
- **Allergens**: Dust mite, pollen, and food allergens trigger Th2 dominance.  
- **Vitamin D**: Deficiency skews toward Th2 responses.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Allergic asthma**: Persistent Th2 cytokine milieu → airway remodeling.  
- **Atopic dermatitis**: IgE‑mediated mast cell activation.  
- **Eosinophilic esophagitis**: IL‑5–driven eosinophil infiltration.  
- **Helminth infections**: Th2 dominance facilitates parasite clearance but may exacerbate allergy.

#### Clinical Biomarkers  
- Elevated serum IgE, eosinophil counts, sputum IL‑5, IL‑13 levels.  

#### Therapeutic Relevance  
- **Biologics**: `Dupilumab` (IL‑4Rα antagonist), `Mepolizumab` (anti‑IL‑5).  
- **Small molecules**: STAT6 inhibitors under investigation.
