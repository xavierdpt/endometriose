**IgG4** is one of the five subclasses of human immunoglobulin G.  It is uniquely characterized by a low affinity for complement and a tendency to undergo Fab‑arm exchange, producing functionally monovalent antibodies.  These properties make IgG4 a key mediator in chronic immune responses and a marker of certain autoimmune and allergy conditions.  

### 2. Location & Context
- Circulates in the plasma at ~3–4 µg mL⁻¹, lower than IgG1 and IgG2.  
- Produced by long‑lived plasma cells in bone marrow and secondary lymphoid organs.  

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the `IgG` family, subclass 4.  
- Two identical heavy chains (`γ4`) and two light chains (κ or λ) linked by disulfide bonds.  
- Contains the canonical CH1‑CH2‑CH3 domains; lacks the C1q‑binding region of IgG1/IgG3.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Functions mainly as an anti‑inflammatory or “tolerogenic” antibody.  
- Binds Fcγ receptors with low affinity, competitively inhibiting IgG1/IgG3‑mediated activation.  
- Forms half‑antibodies via Fab‑arm exchange, reducing cross‑linking ability.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **Fab‑arm exchange** products (heterodimeric IgG4).  
- Glycoforms: predominantly fucosylated, less sialylated than IgG1.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized by B‑cells; secreted via the ER–Golgi pathway.  
- Catabolized in the liver through the neonatal Fc receptor (`FcRn`) recycling pathway.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Low‑affinity binding to FcγRIIB, FcγRIIA, and FcγRIIIB.  
- Does not robustly trigger `Syk`‑mediated phagocytosis or cytokine release.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Elevated in mucosal tissues (e.g., gut, respiratory tract) during chronic inflammation.  
- Involved in the suppression of IgE‑mediated mast cell degranulation.  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Binds to antigens with high affinity but often with low functional valency.  
- Interacts with complement component C1q with minimal activation (≈10⁴‑fold lower).  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `IGHG4` locus variants (e.g., `C allele` of `rs3117`) influence serum IgG4 levels.  
- Rare deletions or duplications of `IGHG4` associated with altered subclass distribution.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Oral tolerance and repeated low‑dose antigen exposure (e.g., food allergens) can increase IgG4.  
- Certain probiotics may promote IgG4‑skewed responses.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Elevated serum IgG4 is a hallmark of IgG4‑related disease (e.g., sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune pancreatitis).  
- IgG4 levels rise in chronic parasitic infections and some cancers, often correlating with a suppressed immune response.  

### Optional: Clinical Biomarkers & Diagnostic Tests
- Serum IgG4 concentration measured by nephelometry or ELISA; >135 mg dL⁻¹ suggests IgG4‑related disease.  
- IgG4/IgG ratio >0.05 is frequently used in diagnostic criteria.  

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance
- **B‑cell depletion** (rituximab) reduces IgG4 levels and ameliorates disease.  
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin** containing high IgG4 can block IgE‑mediated allergic responses.
