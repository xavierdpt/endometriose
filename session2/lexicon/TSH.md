**Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)** is a pituitary‑derived glycoprotein hormone that regulates thyroid hormone production. It acts as the primary endocrine signal for thyroid growth and hormone synthesis, and its serum levels are routinely used as a diagnostic marker for thyroid dysfunction.

### 2. Location & Context
- Secreted by the anterior pituitary `somatotrophs`; circulates in the bloodstream.  
- Normal circulating concentration: ~0.5–4.0 IU/L in adults; peaks in the early morning.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the glycoprotein hormone family (`α`–`β` heterodimer).  
- Shared `α`‑subunit (92 aa) with LH, FSH, hCG; unique `β`‑subunit (120 aa) determines specificity.  
- Disulfide‑bridged dimer; N‑glycosylated at Asn residues.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Stimulates `thyroglobulin` production, iodide uptake, and thyroid hormone (T₃/T₄) secretion.  
- Promotes growth and differentiation of thyroid follicular cells; indirectly affects basal metabolic rate.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Isoforms arise from differential glycosylation of the `β`‑subunit.  
- Circulating complexes include the heterodimer and occasionally a partially glycosylated monomeric form.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized in pituitary `gonadotrophs`; released into circulation via exocytosis.  
- Primarily cleared by the kidneys; hepatic uptake contributes to degradation.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds the thyroid‐stimulating hormone receptor (`TSHR`) on follicular cells.  
- Activates Gs protein → adenylate cyclase → ↑cAMP → PKA cascade; also triggers MAPK signaling.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Thyroid follicular cells**: ↑cytosolic cAMP → transcription of `deiodinases`, `thyroglobulin`, and iodide transporters.  
- **Pituitary**: autocrine regulation of `TRH` secretion.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Negative feedback from free `T₃` and `T₄`.  
- Modulated by `TRH`, `dopamine`, `somatostatin`, and `thyrotropin‑releasing hormone`.  
- Interacts with `iodine`, `selenium`, and `thyroglobulin`.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `TSHR` variants (e.g., Thr192Ala, Gly600Ser) alter receptor sensitivity and are linked to Graves’ disease.  
- Polymorphisms in the `α`‑subunit gene are rare but can affect hormone bioactivity.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Iodine deficiency ↓TSH stimulation due to impaired hormone synthesis.  
- Selenium supplementation modulates TSH levels via antioxidant effects on the thyroid.  
- Goitrogenic substances (e.g., thiocyanate) increase TSH secretion.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Hypothyroidism**: ↑TSH, low T₃/T₄.  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: ↓TSH, high T₃/T₄.  
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: elevated TSH, normal T₃/T₄.  
- Autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves’, Hashimoto’s) involves dysregulated TSH signaling.

#### Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- Serum `TSH` measured by chemiluminescent immunoassays; interpreted alongside free T₃/T₄.

#### Therapeutic Relevance
- **TSH suppression therapy**: high‑dose levothyroxine or radioactive iodine in differentiated thyroid cancer.  
- **TSHR antagonists**: experimental treatments for Graves’ ophthalmopathy.
