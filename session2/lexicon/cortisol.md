**Cortisol** is a glucocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. It plays a central role in the stress response, regulating glucose metabolism, immune function, and circadian rhythms. Elevated or deficient levels are hallmarks of disorders such as Cushing’s syndrome and Addison’s disease.  

## 2. Location & Context  
- Synthesized in the adrenal cortex and released into the bloodstream; also present in interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid.  
- Typical circulating concentration: 5–25 µg/dL (≈ 138–692 nmol/L) with a pronounced diurnal peak in the early morning.  

## 3. Classification & Structure  
- Member of the **steroid** class, specifically a **glucocorticoid**.  
- 21‑carbon skeleton with 3β‑OH, 5‑enol, 11β‑OH, 17α‑OH, 20‑C=O, and 21‑OH groups.  

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Drives gluconeogenesis in liver, lipolysis in adipose tissue, and protein catabolism in muscle.  
- Suppresses pro‑inflammatory cytokine production and modulates the HPA axis through negative feedback.  

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Endogenous analogs: cortisone, corticosterone, 11‑deoxycortisol.  
- Synthetic analogs: prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone.  

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Biosynthesis: cholesterol → pregnenolone → progesterone → 17α‑hydroxypregnenolone → 17α‑hydroxyprogesterone → 11‑deoxycortisol → **cortisol** (via CYP11B1).  
- Catabolism: 11β‑hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2) converts cortisol to cortisone; glucuronidation and sulfation by UGTs/SULTs facilitate excretion.  

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Primary receptor: **glucocorticoid receptor** (`GR`, NR3C1).  
- Genomic action: ligand‑bound `GR` translocates to nucleus, binding glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) to regulate target genes.  
- Non‑genomic actions involve membrane‑associated `GR` activating kinase cascades (e.g., MAPK, PI3K/Akt).  

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Liver**: up‑regulates PEPCK and G6Pase for gluconeogenesis.  
- **Muscle**: enhances proteolysis via ubiquitin‑proteasome pathway.  
- **Adipose**: stimulates lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation.  
- **Immune cells**: inhibits NF‑κB signaling and reduces cytokine secretion.  
- **Brain**: modulates mood, cognition, and HPA axis feedback.  

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Co‑regulation with CRH, ACTH, catecholamines, insulin, and glucagon.  
- Modulated by FKBP5, which influences `GR` sensitivity.  
- High concentrations can bind mineralocorticoid receptor (`MR`), affecting sodium balance.  

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- NR3C1 SNPs: `BclI` (increased sensitivity), `N363S` (enhanced glucocorticoid response).  
- HSD11B1 polymorphisms affecting cortisol regeneration.  
- CYP11B1 variants influencing cortisol biosynthesis.  

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Acute stress and circadian cues elevate cortisol.  
- Sleep deprivation, chronic stress, and high‑caffeine intake raise serum levels.  
- Dietary sodium enhances mineralocorticoid activity, indirectly modulating cortisol effects.  

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Cushing’s syndrome**: chronic hypercortisolism → obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance.  
- **Addison’s disease**: adrenal insufficiency → hypotension, weight loss, hyponatremia.  
- **Glucocorticoid resistance**: impaired `GR` signaling leads to persistent inflammation.  
- Associated with metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and impaired wound healing.  

### Clinical Biomarkers  
- Serum/plasma cortisol levels; salivary cortisol for diurnal variation.  
- Dexamethasone suppression test, CRH stimulation test, and late‑night salivary cortisol.  

### Therapeutic Relevance  
- Exogenous glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone, prednisone, dexamethasone) used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.  
- `GR` antagonists such as mifepristone employed in Cushing’s syndrome and for steroid‑resistant conditions.
