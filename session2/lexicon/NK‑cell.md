**NK‑cell**

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that provide rapid, antigen‑independent cytotoxic responses against virus‑infected and transformed cells. They circulate in the bloodstream and reside in secondary lymphoid organs, the liver, and the uterus, where they contribute to immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis. NK cells are characterized by the expression of surface receptors that balance activating and inhibitory signals to determine target cell lysis and cytokine secretion.

### 2. Location & Context
- Predominantly in peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and uterine decidua.  
- Represent ~10–15 % of circulating lymphocytes; higher density in liver and uterus.  
- Typically short‑lived (~days) but can persist as tissue‑resident or memory NK cells.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family; divided into CD56^bright^ (cytokine‑producing) and CD56^dim^ (cytotoxic) subsets.  
- Express a repertoire of surface receptors: activating (`NKG2D`, `NKp30`, `NKp44`, `NKp46`) and inhibitory (`KIR`, `NKG2A`, `CD94/CD94`).  
- Contain lytic granules with perforin, granzymes A/B, and granulysin.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Cytotoxicity**: release of perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis in target cells.  
- **Cytokine production**: IFN‑γ, TNF‑α, and IL‑10 to shape adaptive responses.  
- **Immune surveillance**: early detection of virally infected or neoplastic cells without prior sensitization.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **Subsets**: CD56^bright^ (high cytokine, low cytotoxicity), CD56^dim^ (high cytotoxicity).  
- **Memory NK cells**: expanded after CMV infection, express `NKG2C`, `CD57`.  
- Post‑translational modifications: tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAM/ITIM motifs on receptor cytoplasmic tails.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Rely on aerobic glycolysis during activation; switch to fatty‑acid oxidation in resting state.  
- Key enzymes: hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase; regulators: mTOR, AMPK.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- **Activating**: `NKG2D` binds MICA/B or ULBPs; `NKp30/44/46` recognize stress ligands.  
- **Inhibitory**: `KIR` recognize HLA‑C group; `NKG2A` binds HLA‑E.  
- Signaling cascades: ITAM‑dependent phosphorylation of `CD3ζ`, `FcεRIγ`; ITIM recruitment of SHP‑1/2; downstream MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and NF‑κB pathways.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Liver NK cells**: contribute to hepatic tolerance and fibrosis regulation.  
- **Uterine NK cells**: promote spiral artery remodeling and trophoblast invasion during pregnancy.  
- **Skin NK cells**: part of resident memory populations in cutaneous immunity.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cytokine milieu shapes activity: `IL‑12`, `IL‑15`, `IL‑18` potentiate activation; `IL‑2` expands populations.  
- Chemokine receptors (`CXCR3`, `CX3CR1`) mediate migration.  
- Interact with T‑cell checkpoints (`PD‑1/PD‑L1`) influencing antitumor responses.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Variations in `KIR` gene cluster (copy number, allele diversity) alter NK cell education and disease susceptibility.  
- Polymorphisms in `NKG2D` and `NKG2A` can modify ligand recognition.  
- Certain `KIR`/HLA haplotypes are associated with improved outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Vitamin D enhances `NKG2D` expression and cytotoxicity.  
- Omega‑3 fatty acids can modulate cytokine production.  
- Chronic stress and smoking suppress NK activity; physical exercise increases it.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Immunodeficiency**: reduced NK function in HIV, cancer, and primary immunodeficiencies.  
- **Autoimmunity**: dysregulated NK cells implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes.  
- **Transplantation**: NK cell alloreactivity influences graft rejection or tolerance.  
- **Cancer**: NK cell infiltration correlates with improved prognosis; tumors often develop NK‑evading ligands.
