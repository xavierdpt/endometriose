`DIO1` (type‑1 deiodinase) is a selenoprotein that catalyzes the removal of an iodine atom from thyroid hormone precursors, converting the prohormone `T4` into the active hormone `T3`.  
It is a key regulator of systemic and local thyroid hormone signaling, especially during early development and in metabolic tissues.

## 2. Location & Context
- Endoplasmic reticulum‑bound, membrane‑associated enzyme in most mammalian cells.  
- Highly expressed in liver, kidney, brain, and the thyroid gland; low levels in skeletal muscle.  
- Substrate and product exchange occurs via the ER lumen‑cytosol interface.

## 3. Classification & Structure
- Belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family (type I, II, III).  
- Single‑pass transmembrane protein (~245 aa) with a selenocysteine (Sec) at the active site and a cysteine‑rich C‑terminal domain.  
- Contains a N‑terminal signal peptide for ER targeting and a C‑terminal lysine‑rich tail.

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Catalyzes outer‑ring deiodination of `T4` → `T3` (activation) and inner‑ring deiodination of `T4` → `rT3` (inactivation).  
- Controls circulating `T3` levels and modulates tissue‑specific thyroid hormone availability.  
- Influences metabolism, growth, and neurodevelopment through `T3`‑dependent transcription.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing yields a 7 kDa isoform lacking the catalytic domain; this isoform may act as a regulatory decoy.  
- Post‑translational modifications: N‑glycosylation of the ER lumen domain; phosphorylation near the C‑terminus may affect stability.  

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized as a preprotein with Sec encoded by a UGA codon and Sec‑specific translational machinery.  
- Activated by endoplasmic reticulum protein folding chaperones; requires selenophosphate as a selenium donor.  
- Degraded by ER‑associated degradation (ERAD) via ubiquitination when misfolded.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- No direct receptor; enzymatic activity indirectly shapes nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TRα/β) signaling by altering ligand availability.  
- Inverse relationship: high `DIO1` activity lowers `T4` and raises `T3`, shifting TRα/β transcriptional programs.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Liver: primary source of systemic `T3`; regulates bile acid synthesis and lipid metabolism.  
- Kidney: modulates local `T3` for renal sodium handling.  
- Brain: limited expression; critical during embryogenesis for neuronal differentiation.  

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Modulated by `T4`/`T3` feedback: high `T3` suppresses `DIO1` transcription via TRα/β; low `T4` induces expression.  
- Selenium levels directly affect enzymatic activity; selenoprotein P serves as a selenium donor.  
- Hormones such as insulin and glucagon influence `DIO1` expression through PI3K/AKT signaling.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNP rs2235544 (C→T) in the 3′‑UTR reduces `DIO1` expression and correlates with altered `T3` levels.  
- Deletion variants in the promoter region are linked to congenital hypothyroidism with low `T3`.  
- No pathogenic loss‑of‑function mutations reported in isolated cases; most variants are regulatory.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Selenium intake is essential; deficiency decreases `DIO1` activity, causing impaired `T3` production.  
- Iodine excess can down‑regulate `DIO1` via negative feedback on thyroid hormone synthesis.  
- Certain xenobiotics (e.g., triiodothyronine analogues) can inhibit `DIO1` through competitive binding.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Reduced `DIO1` activity is observed in non‑thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), contributing to low `T3` levels during critical illness.  
- Elevated `DIO1` expression in hepatocellular carcinoma correlates with altered thyroid hormone metabolism and disease progression.  
- Genetic variants affecting `DIO1` contribute to individual variability in thyroid hormone replacement therapy responses.
