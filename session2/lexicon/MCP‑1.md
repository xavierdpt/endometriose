**Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein‑1 (MCP‑1 / CCL2)** is a small secreted chemokine that orchestrates leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. It is produced by many cell types—including macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth‑muscle cells—and signals primarily through the G‑protein‑coupled receptor `CCR2`.

## 2. Location & Context
- Secreted protein of 99 aa, primarily found in the extracellular matrix and plasma.  
- Expressed at low basal levels in most tissues, up‑regulated upon cytokine stimulation (TNF‑α, IL‑1β).  

## 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the CC chemokine family; possesses two adjacent cysteine residues near the N‑terminus.  
- Contains a conserved cystine knot motif that stabilizes the β‑sheet core.  

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Potent chemoattractant for monocytes, memory T cells, and NK cells.  
- Promotes endothelial adhesion molecule expression, facilitating extravasation.  

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Two known splice variants (`CCL2-1` and `CCL2-2`) with identical mature peptides.  
- Post‑translationally N‑glycosylated at Asn‑63; cleavage by proteases (e.g., neutrophil elastase) yields inactive fragments.  

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized in the cytosol, processed in the ER, and secreted via the classical secretory pathway.  
- Inactivated in plasma by proteolytic cleavage (e.g., by dipeptidyl peptidase‑4).  

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Primary receptor: `CCR2`; also engages `CCR4` at high concentrations.  
- Activation triggers Gi‑protein–dependent pathways: PI3K‑Akt, MAPK/ERK, and PLC‑γ/PKC cascades.  

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In atherosclerotic lesions: recruits monocytes to intima, driving foam‑cell formation.  
- In the CNS: facilitates microglial migration, contributing to neuroinflammation.  

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Up‑regulated by `TNF‑α`, `IL‑1β`, and `IFN‑γ`.  
- Binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on endothelial surfaces, modulating gradient formation.  

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `rs1024611` (−2518 A>G) increases promoter activity; associated with higher circulating levels and disease risk.  
- `rs4586` (C>G) in the 3′ UTR alters mRNA stability.  

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- High‑fat diet and obesity elevate plasma MCP‑1.  
- Cigarette smoke and air pollution acutely induce MCP‑1 expression in airway epithelial cells.  

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and stroke.  
- Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease.  
- Chronic kidney disease, insulin resistance, and neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s).
