**Angiogenesis**

Angiogenesis is the de novo formation of blood vessels from pre‑existing vasculature. It is essential for embryonic development, wound healing, and reproductive cycles, yet its dysregulation contributes to cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and chronic inflammation.

### 1. Introductory Summary
- De novo formation of capillaries from pre‑existing vessels.
- Key developmental, reparative, and pathological process.
- Driven by a balance of pro‑ and anti‑angiogenic signals.

### 2. Location & Context
- Occurs in the interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding tissues.
- Mediated by endothelial cells (ECs) that line existing vessels.
- Prominent in growth plates, placental villi, and tumor stroma.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Category:** Biological pathway / morphogenic process.
- **Key steps:**  
  - Initiation (tip cell selection).  
  - Sprouting / intussusception.  
  - Maturation and lumen formation.  
  - Vessel pruning.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Supplies oxygen and nutrients to growing tissues.
- Facilitates removal of metabolic waste.
- Enables immune cell trafficking during inflammation.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Not applicable (process rather than a single molecule).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Not applicable.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- **Growth factors & receptors**  
  - `VEGFA` → `VEGFR2` (primary driver).  
  - `FGF2` → `FGFR1`.  
  - `Angiopoietin‑1`/`Angiopoietin‑2` → `TIE2`.  
- **Secondary mediators**  
  - Integrin engagement (`αvβ3`).  
  - Notch signaling modulates tip vs. stalk cell fate.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Retina:** regulates vascular density; excess leads to proliferative retinopathy.  
- **Tumor microenvironment:** creates chaotic, leaky vasculature that supports tumor growth.  
- **Muscle repair:** promotes capillary ingrowth for efficient regeneration.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- ECM proteins (collagen, fibronectin) modulate EC migration.  
- Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) remodel ECM to allow sprout extension.  
- Inflammatory cytokines (`TNF‑α`, `IL‑1β`) enhance VEGF expression.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `VEGFA` SNP rs3025039 (+936) associated with altered angiogenic capacity.  
- `VEGFR2` polymorphisms influence responsiveness to anti‑angiogenic therapy.  
- Rare mutations in `TIE2` linked to hereditary venous malformations.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Omega‑3 fatty acids** suppress angiogenesis by down‑regulating `VEGFA`.  
- **Curcumin** and **resveratrol** inhibit VEGF signaling pathways.  
- **Hypoxia** (low O₂) up‑regulates `HIF‑1α`, inducing VEGF transcription.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Cancer:** neovascularization fuels tumor growth and metastasis.  
- **Diabetic retinopathy:** excessive VEGF causes leakage and neovascularization.  
- **Atherosclerosis:** plaque angiogenesis contributes to intraplaque hemorrhage.  
- **Inflammatory disorders:** chronic inflammation sustains angiogenic signaling.

### 13. Clinical Biomarkers & Diagnostic Tests
- Serum `VEGF` levels correlate with disease activity in cancers and eye disorders.  
- Imaging (OCT‑angiography, MRI‑angiography) visualizes pathological vessel growth.

### 14. Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- **Anti‑VEGF agents**: bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept.  
- **Tyrosine kinase inhibitors**: sunitinib, sorafenib target VEGFR and PDGFR.  
- **Angiopoietin‑2 inhibitors**: trebananib (developed for solid tumors).
