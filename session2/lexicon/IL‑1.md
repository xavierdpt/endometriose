**Interleukin‑1 (IL‑1)**  
Interleukin‑1 is a family of pro‑inflammatory cytokines that includes `IL‑1α` and `IL‑1β`.  These proteins are central mediators of innate immunity, inducing fever, leukocyte recruitment, and acute‑phase responses.  Dysregulated IL‑1 signaling underlies many autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Secreted by macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells.  
- Acts extracellularly; plasma concentrations are ~10 pg mL⁻¹ under basal conditions and rise >100 pg mL⁻¹ during inflammation.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- IL‑1 family cytokines are non‑classical secreted proteins lacking signal peptides.  
- Synthesized as ~18 kDa pro‑forms that are cleaved by caspase‑1 to active peptides (117 aa for `IL‑1β`).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Induces fever via hypothalamic COX‑2 upregulation, increases endothelial adhesion molecules, and stimulates acute‑phase proteins (e.g., CRP).  
- Activates T helper 17 cells and promotes Th1 differentiation.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- `IL‑1α` remains mainly intracellular until cell lysis but can also be secreted as a pro‑protein.  
- `IL‑1β` requires inflammasome‑mediated caspase‑1 cleavage; both proteins may be N‑glycosylated.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Initiated by NF‑κB activation → inflammasome assembly (e.g., NLRP3) → caspase‑1 activation → maturation.  
- Degraded by receptor‑mediated internalization and lysosomal proteolysis; soluble `IL1R2` acts as a decoy receptor.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds the type I receptor complex `IL1R1/IL1RAcP`, recruiting MyD88 → IRAK → TRAF6 → NF‑κB/AP‑1 transcription.  
- `IL1R2` sequesters ligand and recruits the natural antagonist `IL‑1Ra`.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In bone: stimulates osteoclastogenesis via RANKL induction.  
- In skin: drives psoriatic inflammation.  
- In CNS: mediates sickness behavior through blood–brain barrier interaction.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Synergizes with TNF‑α, IFN‑γ, and IL‑6; induces IL‑8, MCP‑1, and MMPs.  
- Negatively regulated by `IL‑1Ra` and soluble `IL1R2`.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `IL1B` promoter SNPs (e.g., –511 C>T) increase cytokine production and rheumatoid arthritis risk.  
- `IL1RN` variants influence susceptibility to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- High‑fat diets ↑ IL‑1β via NLRP3 activation; exercise causes transient increases.  
- Smoking induces airway IL‑1 production; omega‑3 fatty acids suppress IL‑1 signaling.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Elevated IL‑1β is a hallmark of cryopyrin‑associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) and other autoinflammatory disorders.  
- Contributes to atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and sepsis‑induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

#### Therapeutic Relevance
- IL‑1 blockade with `anakinra` (recombinant IL‑1Ra), `canakinumab` (anti‑IL‑1β antibody), and `rilonacept` (decoy receptor) treats autoinflammatory diseases and reduces cardiovascular events (CANTOS trial).
