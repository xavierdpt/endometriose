**Free thyroxine (free T4)** is the unbound fraction of the thyroid hormone thyroxine that circulates in the bloodstream. It is the biologically active component that crosses cell membranes and regulates basal metabolism, growth, and development. Clinically, serum free T4 is a primary marker for thyroid function assessment.

## 2. Location & Context
* Found in the serum, unbound to transport proteins (≈ 0.5–1.0 ng dL⁻¹ in adults).  
* Diffuses into virtually all tissues, including the brain, heart, and bone.

## 3. Classification & Structure
* Endocrine hormone; iodinated tetracyclic compound.  
* Contains four iodine atoms on a phenyl ring, one less than triiodothyronine (T3).

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
* Modulates basal metabolic rate, protein synthesis, thermogenesis, and cardiac output.  
* Acts via thyroid hormone receptors `TRα` and `TRβ` to regulate transcription of target genes.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
* Primary active metabolite: 3,5,3′‑triiodothyronine (`T3`).  
* Inactive metabolite: reverse T3 (`rT3`).  
* Additional monoiodinated and sulfated metabolites are formed during catabolism.

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
* Deiodinated by deiodinases D1, D2, and D3 to produce T3 or rT3.  
* Sulfated or glucuronidated for renal and biliary excretion.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
* Binds nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (`TRα`, `TRβ`) to modulate gene transcription.  
* Non‑genomic actions involve integrin `αvβ3` and activation of MAPK/PI3K pathways.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
* CNS: promotes neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.  
* Cardiac muscle: increases heart rate and contractility.  
* Bone: stimulates osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.  
* Liver: regulates cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid synthesis.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
* Antagonized by growth hormone and cortisol; synergistic with insulin‐like growth factor‑1.  
* Influences lipid metabolism via up‑regulation of LDL receptors and cholesterol‑binding proteins.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
* Variants in `DIO1`, `DIO2`, `DIO3` alter peripheral conversion of T4.  
* Mutations in `THRB` can lead to resistance to thyroid hormone.  
* Polymorphisms in `TBG` and `TTR` affect free‑T4 concentrations.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
* Adequate iodine, selenium, zinc, and iron are essential for synthesis and conversion.  
* Goitrogens (e.g., cruciferous vegetables, cassava) and smoking can suppress free‑T4 levels.  
* Medications such as lithium, amiodarone, and glucocorticoids modify hormone metabolism.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
* **Hypothyroidism:** low free‑T4 with compensatory high `TSH`.  
* **Hyperthyroidism:** elevated free‑T4 with suppressed `TSH`.  
* Iodine deficiency, thyroiditis, and postpartum thyroiditis alter free‑T4 dynamics.

### Optional Sections

#### Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
* Serum free‑T4 is measured by equilibrium dialysis or high‑performance immunoassays.  
* The free‑T4/TSH ratio is central to diagnosing and monitoring thyroid disorders.

#### Therapeutic Relevance
* Levothyroxine (synthetic T4) therapy is titrated based on free‑T4 levels.  
* Monitoring of free‑T4 is critical for dose adjustment and preventing overtreatment or undertreatment.
