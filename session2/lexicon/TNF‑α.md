**Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF‑α)**  
TNF‑α is a pro‑inflammatory cytokine that functions as a key mediator of innate immunity and inflammation. It is produced mainly by activated macrophages, but also by T cells, NK cells, and other cell types, and acts systemically to orchestrate immune cell recruitment, cell survival, and apoptotic signaling.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Secreted cytokine found in plasma, interstitial fluid, and at sites of inflammation.  
- Basal expression is low in most tissues but is rapidly up‑regulated upon pathogen recognition or tissue injury.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Member of the TNF superfamily; type II transmembrane protein that is cleaved to a soluble trimer.  
- Contains a cysteine‑rich, α‑helical domain that mediates receptor binding.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Initiates NF‑κB, MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways, leading to transcription of inflammatory genes.  
- Induces fever, acute‑phase protein production, and apoptosis of target cells.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Soluble trimer generated by metalloprotease TACE (ADAM17) cleavage of membrane‑bound precursor.  
- Post‑translational modifications include N‑glycosylation and limited proteolytic processing.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Synthesized as pro‑TNF‑α, cleaved by TACE to the active 17 kDa form.  
- Clearance occurs via receptor‑mediated endocytosis and proteolytic degradation in the liver and kidneys.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Binds TNFR1 (`p55`) and TNFR2 (`p75`); TNFR1 is ubiquitously expressed, TNFR2 mainly on immune cells.  
- Activation triggers MyD88‑independent NF‑κB translocation and caspase‑8‑mediated apoptosis.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- In liver: stimulates acute‑phase protein synthesis (CRP, serum amyloid A).  
- In CNS: contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death.  
- In adipose tissue: promotes insulin resistance via JNK activation.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Synergizes with IL‑1β, IL‑6, and IFN‑γ to amplify inflammatory responses.  
- Cross‑talks with toll‑like receptor signaling and is up‑regulated by LPS binding to CD14/TLR4.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- Promoter polymorphism -308 G>A (rs1800629) enhances transcription and is associated with higher disease susceptibility.  
- Other SNPs in the 3′‑UTR affect mRNA stability and cytokine production.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Smoking, high‑fat diets, and chronic stress elevate circulating TNF‑α levels.  
- Omega‑3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and caloric restriction down‑regulate expression.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Key driver of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and atherosclerosis.  
- Elevated TNF‑α contributes to septic shock, chronic fatigue syndrome, and the cytokine storm seen in severe COVID‑19.

#### Therapeutic Relevance  
- Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab) and soluble receptor decoys (etanercept) are first‑line treatments for autoimmune diseases.  
- Small‑molecule TACE inhibitors are in early clinical development to reduce TNF‑α production.
