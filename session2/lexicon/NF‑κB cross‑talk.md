**NF‑κB cross‑talk**  

NF‑κB cross‑talk refers to the dynamic interplay between the NF‑κB transcription factor network and other signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, TLR, and apoptotic cascades). This integration allows cells to fine‑tune inflammatory, survival, and immune responses. Dysregulation of NF‑κB cross‑talk contributes to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumorigenesis.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Predominantly occurs in the cytoplasm and nucleus of immune and epithelial cells.  
- Activation is triggered by extracellular signals such as cytokines, pathogen‑associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and stress stimuli.  
- Expression of NF‑κB subunits (`p65/RelA`, `p50`, `p52`, `RelB`, `c‑Rel`) is ubiquitous but varies with cell type.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Not a single molecule; a signaling network that integrates multiple pathways.  
- Core components include NF‑κB transcription factor dimers, IκB inhibitors, and IKK complexes.  
- Cross‑talk interfaces involve shared adaptor proteins (e.g., `TRAF`, `TAB`) and scaffold kinases (`TAK1`, `IKKα/β`).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Coordinates transcription of genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and anti‑apoptotic proteins.  
- Modulates cell fate decisions by balancing survival, proliferation, and apoptosis.  
- Fine‑tunes immune responses to pathogens and cellular stress.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Alternative NF‑κB dimers (`RelB/p52`, `p65/p50`) exhibit distinct transcriptional programs.  
- Post‑translational modifications: phosphorylation (by IKK, MAPKs), ubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation alter DNA binding and interaction with co‑activators.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Not directly metabolized; regulation occurs via proteasomal degradation of IκB and turnover of NF‑κB dimers.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **TLR4**: activates NF‑κB via MyD88‑dependent `IRAK4/IRAK1` → `TRAF6` → `TAK1` → IKK.  
- **TNF receptor**: engages `TRADD` → `TNF receptor‑associated death domain (TRADD)`, leading to IKK activation.  
- **IL‑6 receptor**: signals through JAK/STAT, which cooperates with NF‑κB to amplify cytokine gene expression.  
- Cross‑talk with PI3K/AKT: AKT phosphorylates IKKα, enhancing NF‑κB nuclear translocation.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Macrophages**: NF‑κB cross‑talk with `TLR` pathways drives pro‑inflammatory cytokine production.  
- **Epithelial cells**: Interacts with `EGFR` and `Wnt` signaling to regulate barrier integrity.  
- **T cells**: Integration with `CD28` and `TCR` signals modulates activation and differentiation.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- **Cytokines**: `IL‑1β`, `TNF-α`, `IL‑6` synergize with NF‑κB to sustain inflammation.  
- **Reactive oxygen species (ROS)**: activate NF‑κB via `ASK1` and MAPKs; conversely, NF‑κB induces antioxidant genes.  
- **MicroRNAs**: miR‑146a and miR‑155 target components of the NF‑κB pathway, providing negative feedback.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNPs in `NFKB1` promoter (`-94 ins/del ATTG`) alter basal NF‑κB activity.  
- Variants in `IKBKB` (IKKβ) influence susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- **Omega‑3 fatty acids**: inhibit NF‑κB activation by suppressing IKK and MAPK pathways.  
- **Polyphenols** (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol): block IKKα/β phosphorylation and cross‑talk with PI3K/AKT.  
- **Environmental pollutants** (e.g., diesel exhaust) activate NF‑κB through oxidative stress and TLR4 signaling.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Chronic activation contributes to **atherosclerosis**, **colitis**, and **autoimmune diseases**.  
- In cancers, NF‑κB cross‑talk promotes tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, and immune evasion.  
- Elevated NF‑κB target genes (e.g., `IL‑6`, `TNF-α`) serve as biomarkers of inflammation‑driven pathologies.

#### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance  
- **IKK inhibitors** (e.g., BMS‑345541) target the core NF‑κB activation step, reducing cross‑talk with MAPKs.  
- **TLR antagonists** (e.g., eritoran) dampen NF‑κB‑dependent inflammation in sepsis.  
- **miRNA mimics/inhibitors** (e.g., miR‑146a) restore negative feedback on NF‑κB signaling.
