**Corticotropin‑releasing hormone (CRH)**  
Corticotropin‑releasing hormone is a 41‑residue neuropeptide that initiates the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) axis.  It is synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and released into the hypophyseal portal system, where it stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.  CRH thus plays a central role in the endocrine, autonomic, and immune responses to stress.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- Produced mainly in the **paraventricular nucleus** of the hypothalamus.  
- Secreted into the **hypophyseal portal circulation**; present at low basal levels in plasma and high concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid during acute stress.  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Peptide hormone, member of the CRH family.  
- Contains two disulfide bonds linking residues 7–30 and 22–31; C‑terminal amidation.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Activates the HPA axis by stimulating **CRHR1** on corticotrophs, leading to ACTH release.  
- Indirectly increases cortisol, catecholamine release, and modulates anxiety and immune cell activity.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- **Urocortins** (Ucn1–3) are paralogous peptides with overlapping receptor affinity.  
- Post‑translational modifications include disulfide bond formation and C‑terminal amidation.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Inactivated by proteases such as corin and other peptidases in the bloodstream.  
- Clearance occurs primarily through renal excretion of degradation fragments.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Binds Gs‑coupled receptors **CRHR1** and **CRHR2**.  
- Triggers adenylate cyclase → ↑cAMP → PKA activation → transcriptional regulation of ACTH genes.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- In **corticotrophs**: promotes ACTH synthesis and secretion.  
- In the **adrenal cortex**: stimulates cortisol production.  
- In the brain: modulates anxiety circuits, influences sleep–wake regulation.  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Sequestered by the soluble binding protein **CRHBP**, modulating bioavailability.  
- Negative feedback from cortisol and glucocorticoids downregulates CRH transcription.  
- Co‑released with vasopressin and orexins to amplify HPA output.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNPs in the **CRH** promoter (e.g., –1201C > T) affect stress responsiveness.  
- Variants in **CRHR1** (e.g., rs11060481) associate with PTSD and depressive disorders.  
- **CRHBP** polymorphisms correlate with anxiety phenotypes.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Acute stress, sleep deprivation, and high‑fat diets elevate CRH expression.  
- Caffeine and nicotine transiently increase plasma CRH; chronic exercise reduces baseline levels.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Hypersecretion contributes to Cushing’s disease, anxiety, and depression.  
- Hypocortisolism linked to chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.  
- CRH overexpression drives pro‑inflammatory cytokine production in autoimmune conditions.  

#### Optional: Clinical Biomarkers / Therapeutic Relevance  
- **CRH stimulation test** evaluates adrenal responsiveness in suspected adrenal insufficiency.  
- **CRHR1 antagonists** (e.g., antalarmin, pexacerfont) under investigation for anxiety and PTSD.  
- **CRHR2 agonists** explored for anti‑inflammatory therapy.
