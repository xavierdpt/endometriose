Adaptive immunity is the learned, antigen‑specific arm of the immune system that distinguishes self from non‑self through highly diverse receptors. It is carried out by B cells and T cells, which undergo clonal expansion and differentiation to provide long‑lasting protection and immunological memory.

## 2. Location & Context
- Primarily resides in secondary lymphoid organs: lymph nodes, spleen, and mucosa‑associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).  
- Circulates in the bloodstream and lymph; activated cells traffic to peripheral tissues.

## 3. Classification & Structure  
- **Humoral immunity**: mediated by `B cells` and antibodies.  
- **Cell‑mediated immunity**: mediated by `T cells` (`CD4+` helper, `CD8+` cytotoxic).  
- Receptors: variable (V) domains with complementarity‑determining regions (CDRs); antigen presentation via `MHC` class I and II.

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- **Antigen recognition** by `BCR` or `TCR` triggers clonal expansion.  
- Differentiation into effector (plasma cells, cytotoxic T cells) and memory subsets ensures rapid response upon re‑exposure.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Antibody isotypes: `IgM`, `IgD`, `IgG`, `IgA`, `IgE`.  
- T‑cell subsets: `Th1`, `Th2`, `Th17`, `Treg`, `Tc1`, `Tc2`.  
- Class‑switch recombination and somatic hypermutation refine antibody specificity.

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Not applicable (adaptive immunity is not a metabolic pathway).

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- `BCR` and `TCR` complexes recruit `CD3`, `CD79`, and co‑receptors.  
- Co‑stimulatory molecules (`CD28`, `ICOS`, `CTLA‑4`, `PD‑1`) modulate activation.  
- Downstream signaling: NF‑κB, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, leading to cytokine production and gene transcription.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- Mucosal surfaces: IgA‑producing plasma cells maintain barrier immunity.  
- Tumor microenvironment: cytotoxic T cells and `Treg` cells shape anti‑tumor responses.  
- CNS: `microglia` interact with adaptive lymphocytes during neuroinflammation.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Cytokines (`IL‑2`, `IFN‑γ`, `IL‑4`, `IL‑17`) guide differentiation and effector functions.  
- Antigen‑presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) provide antigen and co‑stimuli.  
- Complement components amplify antibody‑mediated clearance.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- `HLA` class I/II allele variations influence antigen presentation and disease susceptibility.  
- Polymorphisms in `CTLA4`, `PDCD1`, `IL2RA` affect T‑cell regulation.  
- TCR V gene usage diversity is shaped by recombination signal sequence variants.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Vitamin D modulates `Treg` induction and antibody responses.  
- Probiotics and gut microbiota shape `Th17/Treg` balance.  
- Chronic infections and vaccinations drive clonal expansion and memory formation.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) involve aberrant B/T cell responses.  
- Primary immunodeficiencies (SCID, X‑linked agammaglobulinemia) result from defects in lymphocyte development.  
- Allergies and hypersensitivity arise from over‑reactive IgE and `Th2` responses.  
- Transplant rejection is mediated by donor‑specific `T cell` activation.

### Optional: Clinical Biomarkers  
- Anti‑dsDNA, anti‑CCP antibodies in autoimmune disease.  
- HLA typing for transplant matching and disease risk.  

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance  
- B‑cell depletion (`rituximab`) for B‑cell mediated disorders.  
- Checkpoint inhibitors (`anti‑CTLA‑4`, `anti‑PD‑1`) to enhance anti‑tumor T‑cell activity.  
- Adoptive cell transfer (CAR‑T cells) harnesses engineered T cells for cancer therapy.
