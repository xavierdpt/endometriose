**CD4⁺ T cell apoptosis**  
Apoptosis of CD4⁺ T cells is a regulated cell‑death process essential for maintaining immune homeostasis, shaping the T‑cell repertoire, and terminating immune responses. It is triggered by both intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor) pathways, and its dysregulation is implicated in autoimmune diseases, chronic infections, and immunodeficiency disorders.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- Occurs within the peripheral immune organs (spleen, lymph nodes, gut‑associated lymphoid tissue) and in inflamed tissues.  
- CD4⁺ T cells express apoptosis regulators at basal levels; expression rises sharply upon activation or in response to cytokine withdrawal.  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- **Classification:** Programmed cell death type 1 (apoptosis).  
- **Key features:** Activation of caspases (initiator caspases 8, 9 and effector caspase 3) and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Eliminates autoreactive or over‑expanded CD4⁺ T‑cell clones, preventing autoimmunity.  
- Contributes to memory T‑cell pool maintenance by removing antigen‑specific cells after pathogen clearance.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Not applicable for a process; however, spliced variants of BCL‑2 family members (e.g., BCL‑XL, BCL‑2) modulate sensitivity to apoptosis.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Not applicable.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **Extrinsic pathway:** Engagement of death receptors `FAS` (`CD95`), `TRAIL-R1` (`DR4`), or `TRAIL-R2` (`DR5`) recruits `FADD` and activates caspase 8.  
- **Intrinsic pathway:** Stress signals (cytokine withdrawal, DNA damage) cause release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, forming the apoptosome with `APAF-1` and activating caspase 9.  
- Downstream effectors include cleavage of PARP and caspase‑dependent DNA fragmentation.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- In the thymus, negative selection of autoreactive CD4⁺ T cells involves apoptosis via `FAS`.  
- In peripheral tissues, apoptosis is accelerated during chronic inflammation (e.g., in autoimmune arthritis).  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Cytokines: IL‑2 withdrawal induces apoptosis; IL‑10 and TGF‑β can confer resistance by up‑regulating anti‑apoptotic proteins.  
- Transcription factors: `FOXO1` promotes apoptosis; `NF‑κB` activation antagonizes it.  
- Metabolites: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplify intrinsic apoptosis signals.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNPs in `FAS` (e.g., −670 G>A) alter receptor expression and are linked to autoimmune susceptibility.  
- Variants in `BCL2` and `BAD` influence apoptosis threshold in CD4⁺ T cells.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Antioxidants (vitamin E, polyphenols) can reduce ROS‑mediated apoptosis.  
- Chronic viral infections (HIV, CMV) down‑regulate apoptosis pathways, contributing to T‑cell exhaustion.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Excessive CD4⁺ T‑cell apoptosis contributes to immunodeficiency in HIV infection and to CD4⁺ lymphopenia in sepsis.  
- Insufficient apoptosis underlies the persistence of autoreactive CD4⁺ T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.  
- Biomarkers: Elevated soluble `FASL` and circulating DNA fragments correlate with disease activity in autoimmune conditions.

**Note:** For therapeutic modulation, agents targeting `FAS` signaling, BCL‑2 family members, or caspase activity are under investigation in autoimmune and chronic infection contexts.
