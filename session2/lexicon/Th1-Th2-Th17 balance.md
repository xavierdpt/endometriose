**Th1/Th2/Th17 balance**

The equilibrium among the CD4⁺ T‑helper subsets **Th1**, **Th2**, and **Th17** orchestrates immune responses to diverse pathogens and determines susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Each subset is driven by distinct cytokine milieus and transcription factors, and their reciprocal suppression shapes the overall immune milieu.

### 2. Location & Context
- Primarily regulated in secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen) and peripheral tissues where naïve CD4⁺ T cells encounter antigen‑presenting cells.
- Expressed in peripheral blood and at sites of infection or inflammation (e.g., lung, gut, skin).

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Functional lineage‑determining transcription factors: `T-bet` (Th1), `GATA3` (Th2), `RORγt` (Th17).
- Cytokine signatures: `IFN‑γ` (Th1), `IL‑4/IL‑5/IL‑13` (Th2), `IL‑17A/F` (Th17).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Th1**: Cell‑mediated immunity; activates macrophages and cytotoxic T cells to eliminate intracellular pathogens.
- **Th2**: Humoral immunity; promotes B‑cell isotype switching (IgE, IgG1) and combats helminths.
- **Th17**: Mucosal defense; recruits neutrophils and drives inflammation against extracellular bacteria and fungi.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Splice variants of `IL‑17A` (`IL‑17A2`) with distinct pro‑inflammatory potency.
- Post‑translational modifications of `RORγt` (phosphorylation) modulate its transcriptional activity.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Differentiation signals involve metabolic reprogramming: `Th1` relies on oxidative phosphorylation, `Th2` on fatty acid oxidation, `Th17` on glycolysis and the `mTORC1` pathway.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Cytokine receptors: `IFNγR` (Th1), `IL‑4Rα`/`IL‑13Rα1` (Th2), `IL‑17RA/RC` (Th17).
- Signaling cascades: `STAT4`/`STAT1` for Th1, `STAT6` for Th2, `STAT3` for Th17; negative regulators include `SOCS1` and `SOCS3`.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Th1**: Enhances macrophage activation in hepatic granulomas.
- **Th2**: Drives IgE production in allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.
- **Th17**: Amplifies neutrophil recruitment in periodontal disease and inflammatory bowel disease.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cytokine cross‑talk: `IL‑12` promotes Th1, `IL‑4` drives Th2, `IL‑6` + `TGF‑β` induces Th17.
- Regulatory T cells (`Treg`, expressing `FOXP3`) modulate the balance via `IL‑10` and `TGF‑β`.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in `IL12RB1` or `IL12RB2` influence Th1 responses and susceptibility to mycobacterial infections.
- Variants in `IL4RA` correlate with atopic disorders.
- Polymorphisms in `RORC` (encoding `RORγt`) affect Th17-mediated autoimmunity.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Vitamin D suppresses Th17 differentiation via `VDR` signaling.
- Short‑chain fatty acids (butyrate) promote Treg over Th17 in the gut.
- Microbiota composition shapes Th17 induction through `IL‑6`/`IL‑23` production.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Th1 dominance**: chronic infections (tuberculosis), certain autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes).
- **Th2 skewing**: allergic diseases, asthma, parasitic infections.
- **Th17 overactivity**: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease.
