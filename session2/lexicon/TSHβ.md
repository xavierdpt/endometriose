**Thyroid‑stimulating hormone β subunit (TSHβ)** is the regulatory chain of the pituitary glycoprotein hormone TSH. It is encoded by the *TSHB* gene and, together with the α‑subunit, forms the heterodimeric hormone that regulates thyroid hormone synthesis and release.  
TSHβ is a small glycoprotein (~92 aa) that is heavily N‑glycosylated and is essential for ligand specificity toward the thyroid‑stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR).  

### 2. Location & Context
- Synthesized in **thyrotrophs** of the anterior pituitary lobe.  
- Secreted into the bloodstream; circulates at 0.3–2 mIU/L in adults.  
- Not found in peripheral tissues in appreciable amounts.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the **glycoprotein hormone family** (TSH, LH, FSH, hCG).  
- Contains the **cystine‑knot** motif and two N‑glycosylation sites (Asn‑27, Asn‑49).  
- 92 aa polypeptide linked to the shared α‑subunit via disulfide bonds.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Binds TSHR on thyroid follicular cells, activating the Gs‑adenylate cyclase pathway.  
- Stimulates synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and promotes iodine uptake.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- No known splice variants; a single functional isoform.  
- Post‑translational **N‑glycosylation** is required for proper folding and secretion.  
- Proteolytic cleavage releases the mature 92‑aa chain from a pro‑TSHB precursor.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Transcribed from the *TSHB* promoter, spliced, translated in the ER, glycosylated in the Golgi, and assembled with the α‑subunit.  
- Secreted into circulation; cleared mainly by **hepatic degradation** and proteolytic enzymes.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- **TSHR**: G‑protein‑coupled receptor; ligand binding induces a conformational change that activates Gs.  
- Signaling cascade: \( \text{TSHβ} \rightarrow \text{TSHR} \rightarrow G_s \rightarrow \text{AC} \rightarrow cAMP \rightarrow PKA \).  
- Genomic effects include upregulation of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Primary target: **thyroid follicular cells** (stimulating hormone synthesis).  
- Minor influence on **adrenal cortex** (cortisol synthesis modulation).  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **TRH**: hypothalamic release stimulates TSHβ transcription.  
- **T4/T3**: provide negative feedback on TRH and TSHβ expression.  
- **TSHR agonists/antagonists**: influence downstream signaling.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Promoter SNPs (e.g., `-3 G/A`) associated with altered basal TSH levels.  
- Loss‑of‑function mutations in *TSHB* cause congenital hypothyroidism (TSHβ‑subunit deficiency).  
- Rare gain‑of‑function variants linked to subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Iodine intake**: deficiency reduces TSHβ production; excess increases TSH secretion (goitrogenic effect).  
- **Goitrogens** (thiocyanate, cyanide) inhibit iodide uptake, indirectly stimulating TSHβ.  
- **Selenium**: necessary for deiodinase activity; deficiency can elevate TSH levels.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Primary hypothyroidism**: elevated serum TSHβ (high TSH).  
- **Primary hyperthyroidism**: suppressed TSHβ (low TSH).  
- **TSH resistance**: mutations in TSHR leading to high TSHβ with normal thyroid hormone levels.  

### Optional: Clinical Biomarkers & Therapeutic Relevance
- **TSH measurement** is the first‑line test for thyroid function screening.  
- Recombinant TSH (rTSH) used clinically to stimulate the thyroid before ^131I or ^123I imaging and therapeutic ablation.
