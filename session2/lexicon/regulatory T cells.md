**Regulatory T cells (Tregs)** are a specialized subset of CD4⁺ T lymphocytes that maintain immune homeostasis by suppressing autoreactive and excessive immune responses. They are defined primarily by surface markers `CD4`, `CD25`, and the transcription factor `FOXP3`. Tregs are essential for preventing autoimmunity, limiting chronic inflammation, and modulating graft tolerance.

### 2. Location & Context
- Found in secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen), peripheral tissues (skin, gut, lung), and inflamed sites.  
- Circulate in the blood as `tTregs` (thymus‑derived) and `iTregs` (peripherally induced).  
- Express high levels of `CD25` (IL‑2Rα) and `CTLA‑4`.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Types**: natural Tregs (`nTregs`) and inducible Tregs (`iTregs`).  
- **Key marker**: `FOXP3`, a forkhead‑winged helix transcription factor essential for Treg development and function.  
- Surface profile: `CD4⁺ CD25⁺ CD127^low/−`, `GITR⁺`, `LAG‑3⁺`.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Suppress effector T cells, B cells, and innate immune cells through cytokine production (`IL‑10`, `TGF‑β`), cytolysis, metabolic disruption, and modulation of dendritic cell maturation.  
- Maintain peripheral tolerance and prevent autoimmune pathology.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Splice variants of `FOXP3` (e.g., `FOXP3ΔE2`) with altered transcriptional activity.  
- Post‑translational modifications: acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination of `FOXP3`, influencing stability and function.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Depend on exogenous `IL‑2` for survival and proliferation.  
- Utilize fatty acid oxidation and glutamine metabolism to sustain suppressive phenotype; glycolysis shifts toward oxidative phosphorylation.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- **IL‑2R**: `CD25` (α), `CD122` (β), `CD132` (γc) signaling via `JAK3/STAT5` to up‑regulate `FOXP3`.  
- **CTLA‑4**: Binds `CD80/CD86`, competing with `CD28` to inhibit T‑cell activation and deliver co‑inhibitory signals.  
- **TGF‑β receptor** and **IL‑10 receptor** mediate downstream SMAD and STAT3 pathways, respectively.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Gut**: interact with microbiota‑derived metabolites (e.g., short‑chain fatty acids) to promote mucosal tolerance.  
- **Placenta**: enhance maternal‑fetal tolerance via `HLA‑G` interactions.  
- **Tumor microenvironment**: often accumulate and suppress antitumor immunity, facilitating tumor escape.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Sequester `IL‑2` from effector T cells, limiting their proliferation.  
- Express ectonucleotidases `CD39`/`CD73`, generating adenosine to dampen inflammation.  
- Release `IL‑35`, a heterodimeric cytokine that suppresses Th17 and Th1 responses.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `FOXP3` mutations cause IPEX syndrome (immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X‑linked).  
- SNPs in `CTLA4`, `IL2RA`, and `PDCD1` genes modulate Treg frequency and disease susceptibility.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Vitamin D**: up‑regulates `FOXP3` and enhances suppressive function.  
- **Short‑chain fatty acids** (butyrate, propionate) from dietary fiber promote `iTreg` differentiation via HDAC inhibition.  
- **Microbiota composition** influences Treg induction and maintenance; dysbiosis reduces Treg populations.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Autoimmune diseases**: reduced number/function (e.g., type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis).  
- **Allergic disorders**: impaired Treg activity correlates with severity of atopic dermatitis and asthma.  
- **Cancer**: high intratumoral Treg levels predict poor prognosis and resistance to checkpoint blockade.  
- **Graft‑versus‑host disease (GVHD)**: insufficient Tregs contribute to severe GVHD; adoptive Treg therapy is investigational.
