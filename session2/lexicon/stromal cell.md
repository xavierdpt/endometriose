**Stromal Cell**

Stromal cells are non‑hematopoietic cells that constitute the supportive framework of tissues and organs. They provide structural integrity, secrete extracellular matrix components, and modulate the microenvironment of resident parenchymal cells and immune cells. Their plasticity underlies both normal tissue homeostasis and pathological remodeling.

### 2. Location & Context
- Found throughout connective tissues, bone marrow, lymphoid organs, and organ stroma (e.g., breast, prostate, adipose).  
- Express high levels of extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors; their abundance varies with tissue and developmental stage.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Classified as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or fibroblastic stromal cells depending on lineage and function.  
- Morphologically spindle‑shaped with abundant cytoplasm; lack specialized organelles but contain extensive collagen‑producing machinery.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Produce collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, forming the extracellular matrix.  
- Secrete cytokines (e.g., `TGF‑β`, `IL‑6`) and chemokines that regulate immune cell recruitment and differentiation.  
- In bone marrow, MSCs support hematopoietic stem cell niches through cell‑contact and soluble factors.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Generate extracellular matrix fragments (matricryptins) that act as signaling molecules.  
- Post‑translational modifications include glycosylation of collagen and proteoglycan synthesis.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Biosynthesis of collagen requires prolyl‑4‑hydroxylase and lysyl‑hydroxylase, which use vitamin C as a cofactor.  
- Matrix degradation mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Respond to mechanical stress via integrin signaling (e.g., `α5β1`) leading to FAK‑MAPK pathways.  
- Secrete growth factors that bind to receptors on neighboring cells: `PDGF`, `FGF`, `VEGF`.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In adipose tissue, stromal‑vascular fraction cells differentiate into adipocytes and regulate adipokine secretion.  
- In the tumor microenvironment, cancer‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs) remodel stroma to promote invasion and angiogenesis.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Modulate cytokine gradients (e.g., `IL‑10`, `IL‑1β`) affecting immune tolerance.  
- Bind and present extracellular matrix components to integrins on epithelial cells, influencing barrier integrity.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Polymorphisms in `COL1A1` and `COL3A1` genes alter collagen structure, impacting fibrosis susceptibility.  
- Variants in `TGFBR2` influence stromal cell responsiveness to transforming growth factor‑β.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Vitamin C deficiency impairs collagen hydroxylation, compromising stromal integrity.  
- Chronic exposure to inflammatory cytokines (e.g., `TNF‑α`) induces fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Excessive activation leads to fibrosis in organs such as liver, lung, and kidney.  
- In cancer, CAFs contribute to drug resistance and metastasis.  
- Dysregulated stromal signaling is implicated in autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and bone marrow failure syndromes.
