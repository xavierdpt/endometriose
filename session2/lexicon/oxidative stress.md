Oxidative stress is a physiological state in which the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (\( \mathrm{O_2^-}\)), hydrogen peroxide (\( \mathrm{H_2O_2}\)), and hydroxyl radical (\( \cdot\mathrm{OH}\)) overwhelms the cellular antioxidant defenses. It is implicated in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases and in the aging process. The imbalance not only damages biomolecules but also dysregulates signaling pathways critical for normal cellular function.

### 2. Location & Context
- Occurs ubiquitously across all cell types but is most pronounced in high‑oxygen‑consumption tissues (heart, brain, liver, kidneys).  
- Elevated ROS levels can also be localized to sub‑cellular compartments such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum.  

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Classified as a **redox imbalance** rather than a discrete macromolecule.  
- Manifestations include **acute** (e.g., ischemia–reperfusion injury) and **chronic** (e.g., long‑term inflammation) forms.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Low‑level ROS function as secondary messengers in pathways like MAPK, NF‑κB, and Nrf2 signaling.  
- Excessive ROS lead to oxidative damage of lipids, proteins, and DNA, impairing cellular homeostasis.

### 5. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Antioxidant enzymes: `SOD`, `CAT`, `GPX`.  
- Non‑enzymatic antioxidants: glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E, coenzyme Q10.  
- Lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde, 4‑HNE) act as secondary signaling molecules.

### 6. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in antioxidant genes influence susceptibility:  
  - `GPX1` Pro198Leu,  
  - `SOD2` Val16Ala,  
  - `NFE2L2` (Nrf2) promoter variants.  

### 7. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Antioxidant‑rich diets (fruits, vegetables) reduce ROS burden.  
- Exposures: smoking, ultraviolet light, air pollution, heavy metals.  

### 8. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Cardiovascular disease** – endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis.  
- **Neurodegeneration** – Alzheimer's, Parkinson's.  
- **Cancer** – DNA mutations, tumor progression.  
- **Aging** – cumulative oxidative damage.

### 9. Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- Lipid peroxidation: malondialdehyde (MDA).  
- DNA oxidation: 8‑oxo‑\(\mathrm{dG}\).  
- Protein carbonyls.  
- Total antioxidant capacity assays.

### 10. Therapeutic Relevance
- **Antioxidant supplementation** (vitamin C, vitamin E, N-acetylcysteine) – mixed efficacy in clinical trials.  
- **Nrf2 activators** (bardoxolone, dimethyl fumarate) enhance endogenous antioxidant gene expression.  
- Lifestyle interventions: smoking cessation, reduced UV exposure, exercise.
