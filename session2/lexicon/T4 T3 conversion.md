**T4→T3 Conversion**  
The conversion of the prohormone `T4` (thyroxine) into the active hormone `T3` (triiodothyronine) is the principal post‑thyroidal activation step that regulates systemic metabolic activity. This process is catalyzed by the selenoprotein deiodinases and occurs in a tissue‑specific manner, allowing precise control of local thyroid hormone action.

### 2. Location & Context
- **Subcellular:** Cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial matrix.  
- **Tissue distribution:** High activity in liver, kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue; lower in skin and peripheral tissues.  
- **Abundance:** `DIO1` is the most abundant deiodinase; `DIO2` is concentrated in brain, pituitary, and cardiac muscle; `DIO3` is expressed in placenta and fetal tissues.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Family:** Selenocysteine‑containing iodothyronine deiodinases (`DIO1`, `DIO2`, `DIO3`).  
- **Key feature:** A unique selenocysteine residue at the active site enables efficient halide removal from the iodine ring.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Generates `T3`, the major ligand for thyroid hormone receptors `TRα` and `TRβ`.  
- Regulates basal metabolic rate, thermogenesis, growth, neurodevelopment, and cardiovascular function.  
- Inactivates excess `T4`/`T3` by producing reverse `T3` (`rT3`) and diiodothyronines.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- `T3` (active), `rT3` (inactive), `5′-diiodothyronine`, `3,3′‑diiodothyronine`.  
- Alternative splicing of `DIO2` produces a shorter, less active isoform in some tissues.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- **Reactions:**  
  \[
  \text{T4} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{DIO1/DIO2}} \text{T3} + \text{I}^-
  \]  
  \[
  \text{T4} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{DIO3}} \text{rT3} + \text{I}^-
  \]  
- **Cofactors:** Selenium (as selenocysteine), NADPH for redox maintenance.  
- **Regulation:** Transcriptional control by thyroid hormone levels, cytokines, glucocorticoids, and dietary selenium.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- `T3` binds nuclear receptors `TRα` and `TRβ`, modulating transcription of metabolic genes.  
- Non‑genomic actions via integrin `αvβ3` affect cell proliferation and angiogenesis.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Brain:** Essential for neuronal maturation and myelination.  
- **Skeletal muscle:** Drives mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty‑acid oxidation.  
- **Adipose tissue:** Stimulates thermogenic gene expression in brown fat.  
- **Pituitary:** Negative feedback on thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH).  
- **Placenta:** `DIO3` limits fetal exposure to maternal `T3`.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Iodide transporters (NIS, pendrin):** Provide substrate for `T4` synthesis.  
- **Selenoprotein synthesis machinery:** Required for functional `DIO` enzymes.  
- **Antioxidants (glutathione):** Protect the selenocysteine active site from oxidative inactivation.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `DIO2` Thr92Ala polymorphism reduces deiodinase activity, associated with altered metabolic rate and cardiovascular risk.  
- Variants in the `DIO3` promoter influence placental hormone conversion and fetal development.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Selenium intake:** Essential for `DIO` activity; deficiency impairs `T3` production.  
- **Iodine status:** Both deficiency and excess affect the ratio of `T4` to `T3`.  
- **Goitrogens** (perchlorate, thiocyanate, certain cruciferous vegetables) inhibit iodine uptake and thus reduce substrate for conversion.  
- **Glucocorticoids** upregulate `DIO2`; inflammatory cytokines downregulate all `DIO`s.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Hypothyroidism:** Reduced `DIO` activity leads to low `T3` despite normal or elevated `T4`.  
- **Non‑thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS):** Downregulation of `DIO1`/`DIO2` during acute illness, causing low `T3` and high `rT3`.  
- **Pregnancy:** Elevated `DIO3` in the placenta protects the fetus from excessive `T3`.  
- **Depression & metabolic syndrome:** Associations with altered peripheral `T3` levels and deiodinase polymorphisms.

**Clinical Biomarkers** – Serum `T3`, `rT3`, and `T4` levels are used to assess deiodinase function in thyroid disorders.  
**Therapeutic Relevance** – Selective `DIO2` inhibitors are explored for hyperthyroid conditions; selenium supplementation may restore `T3` production in deficiency states.
