**Title: T3**

Triiodothyronine (`T3`) is the biologically active form of thyroid hormone that regulates metabolism, growth, and development. It is produced in the thyroid gland and circulates systemically, exerting its effects by binding nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. Its activity is central to energy homeostasis, thermogenesis, and cardiovascular function.

### 2. Location & Context
- Found primarily in the bloodstream and interstitial fluid.  
- Concentration in plasma ≈ 2 – 4 ng mL⁻¹ in healthy adults.  
- Within cells, it localizes to the nucleus where it modulates gene transcription.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the iodothyronine family of monocarboxylic, organoiodine compounds.  
- Structure: L‑tyrosine backbone with three iodine atoms (two at position 5 and one at position 3 of the aromatic ring).  
- Exists in free and conjugated forms (glucuronides, sulfates).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Activates transcription of genes involved in basal metabolic rate, mitochondrial biogenesis, and lipolysis.  
- Enhances cardiac output, heat production, and oxygen consumption.  
- Modulates neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Precursor `T4` (thyroxine) is deiodinated by deiodinases to form `T3`.  
- Reverse T3 (`rT3`) lacks biological activity and competes with `T3` for receptors.  
- Post‑translational modifications not applicable (hormone, not a protein).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized by iodide organification in the thyroid gland.  
- Deiodination: `DIO1` and `DIO2` convert `T4` to `T3`; `DIO3` inactivates `T3` to `rT3`.  
- Excretion primarily via the kidneys; biliary excretion of conjugates.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds nuclear thyroid hormone receptors `TRα` and `TRβ`.  
- Ligand–receptor complex heterodimerizes with RXR and binds thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in target gene promoters.  
- Leads to recruitment of co‑activators or co‑repressors, modulating transcription (genomic action).  
- Non‑genomic effects involve rapid activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways in some cell types.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Heart**: ↑ contractility, ↑ heart rate, ↑ Ca²⁺ sensitivity.  
- **Brain**: promotes neuronal differentiation and myelination.  
- **Liver**: ↑ gluconeogenesis, ↑ cholesterol metabolism.  
- **Bone**: ↑ osteoclastic activity, influencing bone remodeling.  
- **Adipose tissue**: ↑ β‑adrenergic receptor expression, enhancing lipolysis.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Synergizes with catecholamines to amplify metabolic rate.  
- Modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.  
- Influences catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity, affecting catecholamine degradation.  
- Interacts with retinoic acid receptors through shared heterodimerization with RXR.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Polymorphisms in `DIO1`, `DIO2`, and `DIO3` genes alter deiodination efficiency.  
- `THRB` mutations (e.g., RTHβ) cause resistance to `T3`.  
- SNPs in `NIS` (sodium‑iodide symporter) affect thyroid hormone synthesis.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Iodine intake regulates total thyroid hormone production.  
- Selenium status affects deiodinase activity.  
- Phytochemicals (e.g., goitrogens) can inhibit thyroid peroxidase, reducing `T3` synthesis.  
- Chronic alcohol or smoking can alter `T3` metabolism and receptor sensitivity.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Hypothyroidism**: low `T3` levels → fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain.  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: elevated `T3` → heat intolerance, tachycardia, weight loss.  
- **Non‑thyroidal illness syndrome (euthyroid sick syndrome)**: ↓ `T3` with normal `T4` and `TSH`.  
- **Thyroid hormone resistance**: symptoms of hypothyroidism despite normal/high `T3`.

**Therapeutic relevance**  
- Oral `T3` (liothyronine) is prescribed for hypothyroidism refractory to `T4` therapy or in thyroid hormone resistance.  
- Monitoring `T3` levels helps guide dose adjustments in thyroid replacement regimens.
