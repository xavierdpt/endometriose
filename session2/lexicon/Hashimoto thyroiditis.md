**Hashimoto’s thyroiditis**

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and progressive destruction of thyroid follicular cells. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine‑sufficient areas and frequently co‑exists with other autoimmune disorders. The disease is driven by autoantibodies against thyroid‑specific antigens and a T‑cell–mediated cytotoxic response.

### 2. Location & Context
- Primarily affects the **thyroid gland**; infiltrates papillary and follicular epithelium.  
- Presents as a diffuse goiter in ~30 % of patients.  
- Autoantibodies circulate in the **serum** at elevated levels.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Classified as a **non‑Hodgkin, lymphocytic (autoimmune) thyroiditis**.  
- Histology shows **parenchymal destruction**, germinal‑center formation, and fibrosis.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- **Autoantigens**: `TPO` (thyroid peroxidase), `TG` (thyroglobulin), and `NIS` (sodium‑iodide symporter).  
- **Autoantibodies**: anti‑`TPO` and anti‑`TG` IgG/IgM; occasionally anti‑`NIS`.  
- **Cytokines**: elevated `IFN‑γ`, `IL‑2`, `IL‑6`, and `TNF‑α` in affected tissue.

### 6. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- Strong association with `HLA‑DRB1*03`, `HLA‑DQA1*05`.  
- Polymorphisms in `CTLA‑4`, `PTPN22`, and `FOXP3` increase susceptibility.  
- `TLR9` and `TLR7` variants influence innate immune activation.

### 7. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- **Excess iodine** may trigger disease onset in genetically predisposed individuals.  
- **Selenium deficiency** is linked to increased autoantibody titers; supplementation can reduce titres.  
- Smoking is a risk factor for disease progression.

### 8. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Progressive loss of thyroid hormone synthesis → hypothyroidism, fatigue, weight gain.  
- Complications: **thyroid storm** (rare), **goiter‑associated dysphagia**, and infertility.  
- Co‑occurrence with type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and vitiligo is common.

### 9. Clinical Biomarkers  
| Marker | Typical Level | Diagnostic Utility |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| Anti‑`TPO` | > 100 IU/mL | 80–90 % sensitivity for hypothyroidism |
| Anti‑`TG` | Elevated | Adds specificity when combined with anti‑`TPO` |
| Serum `TSH` | > 10 mIU/L | Confirms hypothyroidism |
| Free `T4` | Low | Indicates functional impairment |

### 10. Therapeutic Relevance  
- **Levothyroxine** replacement is the mainstay of treatment; dosing guided by `TSH`.  
- **Glucocorticoids** (prednisone) used for severe, rapid‑progressing disease or for symptomatic goiter.  
- **Immunomodulators** (e.g., abatacept) investigated experimentally.  
- **Selenium** supplementation may lower antibody titres but does not replace hormone therapy.
