**Prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂)**  
Prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) is a bioactive lipid derived from arachidonic acid that serves as a key mediator of inflammation, pain, fever, and vascular tone. It acts through G‑protein‑coupled receptors on a wide range of cells to modulate both local and systemic physiological responses.

### 2. Location & Context
- Synthesized in the cytoplasm of many cell types (e.g., macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth‑muscle cells) and released into the extracellular milieu.  
- Peak concentrations reach 10–100 nM in inflamed tissues; basal levels in plasma are typically < 10 pM.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the prostaglandin family, belonging to the cyclopentenone prostanoid class.  
- Structure: a cyclopentane ring with a side‑chain containing a trans‑conjugated diene and an α‑β unsaturated aldehyde/ketone moiety; the 15‑hydroxy group confers polarity.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Acts as a vasodilator and increases vascular permeability, facilitating leukocyte recruitment.  
- Modulates pain perception via sensitization of nociceptors and contributes to fever by acting on the hypothalamus.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Metabolites: PGE₂‑D₁, PGE₂‑D₂ (di‑dehydro‑PGE₂) generated by CYP enzymes; 6,15‑dihydroxy‑PGE₂ formed by 15‑lipoxygenase.  
- Post‑synthetic modifications: esterification of the C‑15 hydroxyl group in circulating plasma.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Biosynthesis: arachidonic acid → **cPLA₂** → **COX‑1/COX‑2** → **PGH₂** → **PGES** (microsomal/soluble).  
- Catabolism: **15‑lipoxygenase** → 15‑HPETE → downstream ketones; **PGE₂‑reducing enzyme** (PEPCK‑like) forms 13‑ketoprostaglandins.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds four GPCRs: **EP1–EP4** (encoded by *PTGER1–PTGER4*).  
  - EP1: Gαq → Ca²⁺ mobilization.  
  - EP2/EP4: Gαs → ↑cAMP → PKA activation.  
  - EP3: Gαi → ↓cAMP; isoforms may couple to Gαq.  
- Receptor engagement elicits diverse downstream cascades, including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and NF‑κB pathways.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Endothelial cells:** induces nitric‑oxide synthase, amplifying vasodilation.  
- **Smooth‑muscle cells:** mediates bronchoconstriction via EP1/EP3.  
- **Bone:** stimulates osteoclast differentiation through EP4 signaling.  
- **Neurons:** modulates synaptic plasticity and pain sensitization.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Synergistic with cytokines such as IL‑1β and TNF‑α to amplify inflammatory gene expression.  
- Interferes with thromboxane A₂ signaling by competing for EP receptors on platelets.  
- Regulates COX‑2 expression via positive feedback loops involving NF‑κB.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in *PTGER4* (e.g., rs1036597) associated with altered asthma severity.  
- Variants in the *PTGES* promoter (−181 G > C) influence PGE₂ production in inflammatory disorders.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Omega‑3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA) compete with arachidonic acid, reducing PGE₂ synthesis.  
- COX inhibitors (NSAIDs) decrease PGE₂ levels; selective COX‑2 inhibitors (celecoxib) preferentially reduce PGE₂.  
- Smoking increases COX‑2 expression, elevating PGE₂ in airway tissues.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Inflammatory diseases:** Elevated PGE₂ in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.  
- **Pain and fever:** Primary mediator of prostaglandin‑induced hyperalgesia and pyrexia.  
- **Cancer:** Tumor‑derived PGE₂ promotes angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers.  
- **Cardiovascular:** PGE₂ contributes to platelet aggregation and atherogenesis via EP3/EP4 signaling.

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance
- **NSAIDs** and COX‑2 selective inhibitors lower PGE₂ to treat pain and inflammation.  
- **EP4 antagonists** are under investigation for rheumatoid arthritis and colorectal cancer.  
- **Prostanoid analogs** (misoprostol) modulate PGE₂ pathways for gastric protection and uterine contraction.
