**Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP)**  
Chronic pelvic pain is a multifactorial condition characterized by persistent discomfort or pain in the pelvic region lasting longer than six months. It can arise from gynecologic, urologic, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or neuropathic sources, and often involves complex interactions between peripheral and central nervous systems. CPP is a leading cause of disability among reproductive‑age women and poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

### 1. Introductory Summary  
Chronic pelvic pain is a persistent, multifactorial pain syndrome affecting the lower abdomen and pelvis. It often stems from gynecologic, urologic, gastrointestinal, or neuropathic origins and can lead to significant morbidity. The condition is characterized by a complex interplay of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Predominantly localizes to the lower abdomen, pelvic cavity, perineum, and sometimes the lower back.  
- Affects the pelvic organs (uterus, ovaries, bladder, bowel), pelvic floor musculature, and associated nerves.  
- Prevalence: ~10–15 % of reproductive‑age women; higher in those with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometriosis.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- **Primary CPP:** No identifiable organic pathology.  
- **Secondary CPP:** Resulting from an underlying disease (e.g., endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome).  
- Subtypes based on pain distribution: visceral, somatic, or neuropathic.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
Not applicable (disease state rather than normal physiology).

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
Not applicable.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
Not applicable.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **Peripheral sensitization:** Inflammatory mediators (IL‑1β, TNF‑α, prostaglandins) sensitize nociceptors.  
- **Central sensitization:** Upregulation of NMDA receptors and spinal cord dorsal horn neurons increases pain transmission.  
- **Neuro‑immune cross‑talk:** Mast cell activation releases histamine and tryptase, further amplifying nociception.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Pelvic floor myofascial dysfunction** contributes to somatic pain.  
- **Endometriotic lesions** release cytokines and prostaglandins, producing visceral pain.  
- **Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome** involves urothelial barrier dysfunction and afferent hyperexcitability.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- **Inflammatory cytokines** (IL‑6, IL‑8) correlate with pain severity.  
- **Serotonergic system** modulation (serotonin transporter SLC6A4) influences pain perception.  
- **Hormonal milieu** (estrogen, progesterone) affects endometrial sensitivity and pain thresholds.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- **COMT Val158Met** allele associated with increased pain sensitivity.  
- **Serotonin transporter (5‑HTTLPR) short allele** linked to higher CPP risk.  
- **CYP2D6 polymorphisms** influence efficacy of opioid analgesics used in CPP.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- **High‑fat, low‑fiber diets** may exacerbate gastrointestinal contributors.  
- **Smoking** associated with increased pelvic floor pain.  
- **Chronic stress** and anxiety heighten central sensitization.  
- **Physical inactivity** can worsen myofascial components.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic adhesions.  
- Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.  
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  
- Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.  
- Pelvic floor myalgia, musculoskeletal dysfunction.  
- Fibromyalgia and other central pain disorders.
