**Prostaglandin‑dependent recruitment of macrophages**

Prostaglandin (PG) signaling orchestrates the migration of circulating monocytes to sites of tissue injury or inflammation.  PGs, particularly `PGE2` and `PGD2`, act through G‑protein–coupled receptors on endothelial cells, stromal cells, and immune cells to induce chemokine production and alter vascular permeability, thereby creating a permissive microenvironment for macrophage infiltration.

### 2. Location & Context
- **Site of action:** PGs are synthesized locally in injured or inflamed tissues (e.g., skin, lung, arterial wall).  
- **Cellular sources:** `COX‑2`‑expressing fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and activated macrophages.  
- **Target cells:** Monocytes and immature macrophages in the bloodstream; endothelial cells and stromal cells lining tissue beds.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Family:** Lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid.  
- **Key structural motif:** 1,2‑epoxy‑cyclopentane ring; conjugated double bonds.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Primary role:** Induce chemokine secretion (`CCL2`, `CXCL1`, `CXCL2`) and up‑regulate adhesion molecules (`VCAM‑1`, `ICAM‑1`) on endothelium.  
- **Outcome:** Transendothelial migration of monocytes, followed by differentiation into tissue macrophages.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **Analogues:** `PGE2`, `PGD2`, `PGI2`, `PGF2α`.  
- **Metabolites:** Inactivation via 15‑hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase producing `15‑dPGJ2`.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- **Biosynthesis:** Arachidonic acid → `COX‑2` → PGH₂ → specific PG synthases (e.g., `PGES` for `PGE2`).  
- **Degradation:** 15‑hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase; conjugation by sulfotransferases.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- **Receptors on endothelial/stromal cells:** `EP1`–`EP4`, `DP1`, `DP2`.  
- **Signaling cascades:**  
  - `EP2/EP4` → cAMP ↑ → PKA activation → transcription of `CCL2`.  
  - `DP2` → Gi → MAPK activation → `CXCL1` transcription.  
- **Non‑canonical pathways:** PGD₂ can activate `CRTH2` (GPCR) on T cells, influencing cytokine milieu that modulates macrophage recruitment.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Lung:** `PGE2` mediates bronchiolar macrophage influx during allergic inflammation.  
- **Atherosclerotic plaque:** `PGI2` and `PGE2` up‑regulate monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, accelerating plaque macrophage accumulation.  
- **Skin wound healing:** `PGD2` stimulates dermal macrophage recruitment, facilitating collagen remodeling.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Cytokines:** `TNF-α` and `IL‑1β` induce `COX‑2` expression, amplifying PG production.  
- **Chemokines:** PG‑induced chemokine secretion creates autocrine and paracrine loops that sustain monocyte chemotaxis.  
- **Adhesion molecules:** PGs up‑regulate `E‑selectin` and `P‑selectin` on endothelial cells, enhancing leukocyte rolling.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- **`PTGS2` (COX‑2) SNPs** (e.g., rs689466) correlate with altered PG output and susceptibility to inflammatory disorders.  
- **`PTGER4` (EP4) polymorphisms** influence monocyte chemotaxis in response to `PGE2`.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Omega‑3 fatty acids** reduce arachidonic acid substrate availability, lowering PG synthesis.  
- **NSAIDs** (COX inhibitors) blunt PG production, attenuating macrophage recruitment but risking impaired wound healing.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Chronic inflammatory diseases** (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease) exhibit elevated PG levels and excessive macrophage infiltration.  
- **Metabolic syndrome:** PG-mediated macrophage recruitment contributes to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance.  
- **Cancer:** Tumor-derived PGs promote macrophage (tumor‑associated macrophage) infiltration, supporting tumor progression and immunosuppression.

### Optional Sections

#### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting
- **COX‑2 inhibitors** (celecoxib) reduce macrophage recruitment in atherosclerosis.  
- **EP4 antagonists** (ONO‑O4‑021) under investigation for reducing inflammatory macrophage infiltration in arthritis.  
- **CRTH2 antagonists** (fevipiprant) may modulate PGD₂‑mediated macrophage recruitment in asthma.
