**IP-10 (Interferon‑γ‑Induced Protein 10 / CXCL10)**  

IP‑10 is a small, secreted chemokine induced by interferon‑γ that functions primarily as a chemoattractant for activated T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. It plays a key role in cell trafficking during immune surveillance and in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Elevated IP‑10 levels are a hallmark of numerous infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic conditions.

### 1. Introductory Summary  
IP‑10 is a 10‑kDa CXC chemokine encoded by the *CXCL10* gene. It is produced by a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts, in response to interferon‑γ and other pro‑inflammatory stimuli. The protein orchestrates the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation and modulates adaptive immunity.

### 2. Location & Context  
- **Extracellular milieu**: secreted into plasma, lymph, and interstitial fluid.  
- **Cellular sources**: endothelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.  
- **Concentration**: plasma levels range from 10–200 pg mL⁻¹ in healthy individuals, rising to 1–10 ng mL⁻¹ during acute inflammation.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- **Family**: CXC chemokine subfamily (ELR⁻).  
- **Structure**: 68–72 aa mature peptide with a conserved N‑terminal cysteine motif (`Cys–X–Cys`) and a glycine‑rich central region.  
- **Post‑translational**: N‑terminal pyroglutamic acid formation and potential C‑terminal glycosylation.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- **Chemotaxis**: attracts CXCR3‑expressing CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cells, NK cells, and monocytes.  
- **Immunoregulation**: enhances Th1 responses, promotes T‑cell adhesion, and induces apoptosis in activated T cells via CXCR3 signaling.  
- **Angiostasis**: inhibits endothelial proliferation and migration, counteracting angiogenesis.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- **Isoforms**: alternative splicing yields a short form lacking the C‑terminal tail; the functional significance is unclear.  
- **Polymorphic variants**: `-2518 G/A` promoter SNP influences transcriptional activity and plasma levels.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- **Synthesis**: transcriptionally activated by IFN‑γ via the JAK‑STAT1 pathway.  
- **Degradation**: proteolytic cleavage by neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinases; clearance primarily by the liver and kidneys.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **Receptor**: `CXCR3`.  
- **Signal transduction**: G‑protein–coupled activation of PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, and PLCγ, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and chemotaxis.  
- **Cross‑talk**: binds to CXCR3‑B and CXCR3‑A splice variants with differing affinities.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Lung**: drives recruitment of T cells in viral pneumonia and asthma.  
- **Heart**: mediates inflammatory infiltration in myocarditis and atherosclerosis.  
- **Central nervous system**: contributes to neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis by attracting CXCR3⁺ T cells across the blood–brain barrier.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- **Cytokines**: synergizes with IFN‑γ, TNF‑α, and IL‑12; inhibited by IL‑10.  
- **Chemokines**: works cooperatively with CXCL9 and CXCL11 to recruit Th1 cells.  
- **Growth factors**: modulates VEGF signaling by downregulating endothelial proliferation.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- `-2518 G/A` SNP correlates with susceptibility to tuberculosis, Crohn’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus.  
- Loss‑of‑function mutations in *CXCL10* are rare but have been reported in patients with impaired antiviral immunity.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Infectious diseases**: chronic high IP‑10 levels in hepatitis C, HIV, and COVID‑19 correlate with disease severity.  
- **Autoimmune disorders**: elevated serum IP‑10 is a biomarker for active lupus nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis relapse.  
- **Cardiovascular disease**: IP‑10 promotes atherogenesis by recruiting monocytes to the plaque.  
- **Cancer**: high tumor IP‑10 expression associates with immune infiltration and improved prognosis in some solid tumors, yet promotes tumor growth in others via CXCR3 signaling.

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance  
- **Targeting strategies**: neutralizing antibodies against IP‑10 or CXCR3 antagonists are in preclinical development for autoimmune and fibrotic diseases.  
- **Biomarker utility**: plasma IP‑10 levels guide treatment decisions in hepatitis C, systemic lupus erythematosus, and COVID‑19 management.
