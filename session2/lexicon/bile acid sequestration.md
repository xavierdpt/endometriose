Bile acid sequestration is the process by which insoluble resins or polymers bind circulating bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their reabsorption in the enterohepatic circulation. By interrupting this cycle, sequestrants lower circulating cholesterol levels and modulate lipid metabolism, and are clinically employed as non‑statin hypocholesterolemic agents. The mechanism also influences gut hormone secretion and intestinal motility.

### 2. Location & Context
- Occurs primarily in the ileum and proximal colon, where bile acids are reabsorbed.  
- Sequestrants remain in the lumen and are not absorbed; their concentration is determined by dosage and gut transit time.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Resins**: Polystyrene sulfonate (cholestyramine), polyethylene glycol alkyl ether sulfate (colestipol).  
- **Polymeric ion exchangers**: Quaternary ammonium polysaccharides (colesevelam).  
- All are anionic polymers capable of forming insoluble complexes with bile acids.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Prevents reabsorption of bile acids, forcing hepatic conversion of cholesterol to new bile acids.  
- Decreases LDL‑cholesterol and modestly increases HDL‑cholesterol; can reduce triglycerides.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Synthetic analogs with varying molecular weights and ion‑exchange capacities (e.g., high‑molecular‑weight colesevelam).  
- No significant post‑translational modifications occur, as these are non‑proteinaceous.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Sequestrants are not metabolized; they are excreted unchanged in feces.  
- The bound bile acids are eliminated, prompting de novo synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Not applicable; sequestrants act physically rather than through receptor-mediated signaling.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Intestine**: Decreases micelle formation, reducing dietary lipid absorption.  
- **Liver**: Indirectly increases HMG‑CoA reductase activity to replenish cholesterol pool.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Bind to bile acids, bilirubin, and certain drugs (e.g., levothyroxine), potentially reducing their absorption.  
- Influence gut microbiota composition by altering bile acid pool composition.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- No direct gene variants alter sequestration itself, but polymorphisms in genes affecting bile acid synthesis (e.g., *CYP7A1*) can modulate therapeutic response.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- High‑fat diets increase bile acid synthesis, potentially enhancing sequestrant efficacy.  
- Fiber‑rich diets may compete with sequestrants for bile acids, affecting binding efficiency.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Hypercholesterolemia, primary biliary cholangitis, and cholestatic liver diseases may benefit from sequestration.  
- Bile acid malabsorption can lead to diarrhea; sequestrants are used therapeutically for this condition.

### Optional Sections

#### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting
- **Cholestyramine**, **colestipol**, **colesevelam** are FDA‑approved sequestrants for lowering LDL‑cholesterol.  
- They are also employed in treating bile acid diarrhea and, occasionally, in managing gallstone disease pre‑operatively.

#### Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests
- Serum total cholesterol, LDL‑cholesterol, and fecal bile acid excretion levels are monitored to assess efficacy.
