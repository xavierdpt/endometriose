**Th1**  
Th1 cells are a subset of CD4⁺ T helper cells that orchestrate cell‑mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. They are distinguished by their production of interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ) and by the master transcription factor `TBX21` (T‑bet). Th1 responses are crucial for activating macrophages and promoting cytotoxic T cell function.

### 2. Location & Context
- Resident in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes) and peripheral tissues (lung, gut, liver).  
- Circulate in the blood; their proportion among CD4⁺ T cells is typically 20–30 % under steady‑state conditions.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Functional class: **CD4⁺ T helper cell subset**.  
- Core marker genes: `TBX21`, `STAT4`, `IFNG`.  
- Cytokine signature: `IFNG`, `IL2`, `TNFα`.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Activate macrophages and dendritic cells via IFN‑γ, enhancing antigen presentation and microbicidal activity.  
- Promote differentiation of cytotoxic CD8⁺ T cells and natural killer cells.  
- Mediate inflammation in granulomatous diseases.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Not applicable (Th1 is a cell phenotype, not a molecule).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Not applicable.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Recognize antigens via `TCR` and `CD4`; engage `IL12RB1/IL12RB2` upon IL‑12 stimulation.  
- Signal through `STAT4` → `TBX21` → IFN‑γ production; IFN‑γ then signals via `IFNGR` and `STAT1` in target cells.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In the lung, Th1 cells contribute to granuloma formation in tuberculosis.  
- In the liver, they activate Kupffer cells to control hepatitis‑B virus replication.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Cytokine cross‑talk:** IL‑4 and IL‑10 suppress Th1 differentiation; IL‑2 supports survival.  
- IFN‑γ acts in an autocrine loop to further enhance Th1 polarization.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in `IL12RB1`, `IL12RB2`, and `TBX21` influence Th1 bias and are linked to susceptibility to tuberculosis and type 1 diabetes.  
- Variants in `IFNG` promoter affect IFN‑γ secretion levels.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Vitamin D down‑regulates `TBX21` expression, dampening Th1 responses.  
- Short‑chain fatty acids from gut microbiota can modulate Th1 differentiation through histone deacetylase inhibition.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Hyperactive Th1 immunity underlies autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, and type 1 diabetes.  
- Impaired Th1 function increases vulnerability to intracellular bacterial and viral infections (e.g., *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, HIV).

### Therapeutic Relevance
- IL‑12/IL‑23 pathway inhibitors (e.g., ustekinumab) reduce Th1 activity in psoriasis and Crohn’s disease.  
- Small‑molecule T‑bet inhibitors are under investigation for dampening Th1‑mediated inflammation.
