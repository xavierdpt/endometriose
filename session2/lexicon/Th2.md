**Th2 cells** are a subset of CD4⁺ T helper cells that orchestrate humoral immunity and allergic inflammation.  They are characterized by the production of cytokines such as IL‑4, IL‑5, and IL‑13, which promote B‑cell class switching to IgE and activate eosinophils.  Th2 responses are crucial for defense against extracellular parasites but are also implicated in many allergic disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Found in secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen), peripheral blood, and mucosal tissues (gut, lungs).  
- Constitute ~5–15 % of circulating CD4⁺ T cells in healthy adults.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Subclass of CD4⁺ T helper cells; differentiation driven by IL‑4 and transcription factor **`GATA3`**.  
- Express surface markers CD4⁺, CCR4, CCR8, and the IL‑4Rα chain.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Secrete IL‑4, IL‑5, IL‑13 → drive B‑cell IgE class switching, eosinophil growth, and mucus production.  
- Provide help to B cells for antibody production and support type‑2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s).

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Cytokine products: **`IL‑4`**, **`IL‑5`**, **`IL‑13`**.  
- Transcription factor **`GATA3`** undergoes post‑translational phosphorylation influencing its activity.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Respond to IL‑4 via IL‑4Rα/γc; downstream STAT6 activation.  
- IL‑13 signals through IL‑13Rα1/IL‑4Rα heterodimer; IL‑5 signals via IL‑5Rα/βc complex.  
- Signaling is largely genomic, modulating gene expression profiles of target cells.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In the lungs: promote goblet cell hyperplasia and airway hyperresponsiveness.  
- In the gut: stimulate IgA production and mucosal barrier responses.  
- In skin: contribute to atopic dermatitis via eosinophil recruitment.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Crosstalk with dendritic cells (IL‑4/IL‑13 production), B cells (IL‑4‑driven class switching), and innate lymphoid cells (IL‑5/IL‑13 feedback).  
- Modulates regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation through IL‑10 and TGF‑β balance.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Variants in **`GATA3`** and IL‑4/IL‑13 promoter regions correlate with atopic disease susceptibility.  
- SNPs in IL‑4Rα (e.g., **`R576`**) influence cytokine signaling strength.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Helminth infections skew immunity toward Th2, enhancing parasite clearance.  
- Allergen exposure in genetically predisposed individuals drives Th2 activation and allergic sensitization.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Asthma** (especially eosinophilic phenotype), atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and hyper IgE syndrome.  
- Elevated serum IgE, eosinophil counts, and IL‑4/IL‑13 levels serve as disease biomarkers.

### Optional Sections

#### Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests
- Serum IgE concentration, peripheral eosinophil count, IL‑4/IL‑13 ELISA.  
- Flow cytometry for Th2 surface markers (CCR4, CCR8).

#### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting
- **Dupilumab** (anti‑IL‑4Rα) blocks IL‑4/IL‑13 signaling; effective in moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis and asthma.  
- **Mepolizumab** and **reslizumab** (anti‑IL‑5) reduce eosinophil-driven inflammation.  
- **Tralokinumab** and **Lebrikizumab** (anti‑IL‑13) are under investigation for asthma.
