**Gram‑negative bacteria**

Gram‑negative bacteria are a diverse group of prokaryotes distinguished by a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). They inhabit many ecological niches, from soil and water to the human microbiota, and play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, pathogenesis, and the modulation of host immunity.

### 2. Location & Context
- **Environments:** soil, freshwater, marine habitats, plant surfaces, and the mucosal surfaces of animals.  
- **Human sites:** gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, respiratory tract, skin, and oral cavity.  
- **Abundance:** constitute a major fraction of the microbiome; e.g., *Escherichia coli* and *Bacteroides fragilis* dominate the gut lumen.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Taxonomy:** primarily in the phyla `Proteobacteria`, `Bacteroidetes`, `Verrucomicrobia`, and `Chlamydiae`.  
- **Key structural features:** outer membrane with LPS; porin proteins (e.g., OmpF) form aqueous channels; periplasmic space houses enzymes for nutrient uptake.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Metabolic versatility:** capable of fermentative, respiratory, and anaerobic pathways; many synthesize short‑chain fatty acids, nitrogenous compounds, and secondary metabolites.  
- **Host interactions:** colonization can be commensal or pathogenic; produce toxins (e.g., Shiga, cholera) that manipulate host cells.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **LPS:** core oligosaccharide and O‑antigen chains confer endotoxin activity; variants define serotypes.  
- **Outer membrane proteins (OMPs):** e.g., `LamB`, `OmpA` serve as nutrient transporters or virulence factors.  
- **Secreted enzymes:** lipases, proteases, and exotoxins (e.g., hemolysin).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- **Central pathways:** glycolysis, TCA cycle, and mixed‑acid fermentation.  
- **Biotransformation:** reduction of nitrate to nitrite (denitrification) and biotransformation of xenobiotics via β‑lactamases and monooxygenases.  
- **Co‑factors:** use of metal ions (Fe, Mn, Cu) in electron transport chains.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- **TLR4‑MD‑2 complex:** LPS binds `TLR4` on innate immune cells, initiating NF‑κB signaling and cytokine production.  
- **Quorum sensing:** autoinducer molecules (e.g., AI‑2) regulate biofilm formation and virulence gene expression.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Gut colonizers:** ferment polysaccharides, producing short‑chain fatty acids that influence epithelial barrier function.  
- **Respiratory pathogens:** *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* secretes pyocyanin, causing oxidative damage in cystic fibrosis lungs.  
- **Urinary tract colonizers:** *Proteus mirabilis* induces urease activity, precipitating kidney stones.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Microbiome cross‑talk:** competitive inhibition of pathogens via bacteriocin production.  
- **Host hormones:** glucocorticoids can alter mucosal immune responses, affecting bacterial adherence.  
- **Metabolites:** SCFAs modulate host gene expression via G‑protein coupled receptors.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- **Antibiotic resistance genes:** β‑lactamases (e.g., `bla_TEM`, `bla_NDM`), efflux pump regulators (`ramA`).  
- **LPS O‑antigen gene clusters** show high variability, influencing immune evasion.  
- **Pseudomonas* `exoU` alleles** determine cytotoxicity levels.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Dietary fibers** promote growth of LPS‑rich Bacteroidetes; high‑fat diets favor Proteobacteria.  
- **Antibiotic exposure** selects for resistant strains, disrupting microbiota balance.  
- **Environmental pollutants** (e.g., heavy metals) can induce stress responses that alter virulence gene expression.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Sepsis:** excessive LPS release triggers systemic inflammatory response syndrome.  
- **Inflammatory bowel disease:** dysbiosis of gram‑negative species contributes to mucosal inflammation.  
- **Pneumonia & UTIs:** virulent strains cause tissue damage through toxin secretion and biofilm formation.  
- **Endotoxemia:** low‑grade LPS translocation linked to metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.
