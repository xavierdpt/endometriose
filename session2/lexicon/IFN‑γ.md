Interferon‑γ (`IFN‑γ`) is a type II cytokine produced predominantly by activated T cells and natural killer cells. It plays a central role in innate and adaptive immunity by activating macrophages, up‑regulating antigen presentation, and shaping T helper cell differentiation. Elevated `IFN‑γ` levels are hallmark of Th1‑mediated immune responses and various inflammatory diseases.

## 2. Location & Context
- Secreted cytokine found in extracellular fluid and plasma.  
- Synthesized in the cytoplasm of activated CD4⁺ Th1, CD8⁺ cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells; stored in cytoplasmic vesicles before secretion.  
- Concentrations rise to 10–100 pg mL⁻¹ in active infections and can exceed 1 ng mL⁻¹ during cytokine storms.

## 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the type II interferon family, related to `IFN‑α/β` but distinct in receptor usage.  
- Homodimeric glycoprotein (~170 aa per subunit), N‑terminal signal peptide followed by a β‑sheet‑rich core and a C‑terminal glycosylated tail.

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Activates macrophages to increase phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production.  
- Enhances expression of MHC class I and II molecules, improving antigen presentation.  
- Promotes differentiation of naïve CD4⁺ T cells into Th1 cells via STAT1 signaling.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Two main splice variants: `IFN‑γ1` (full-length) and `IFN‑γ2` (C‑terminal truncation) found in some species.  
- Post‑translationally N‑glycosylated at Asn-66; C‑terminal amidation can occur in certain primate species.

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized by ribosomal translation; secreted via the conventional ER‑Golgi pathway.  
- Degraded extracellularly by proteases such as cathepsin G and by macrophage-mediated proteolysis.  
- Rapid clearance from circulation with a half‑life of ~3 minutes in humans.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds heterodimeric `IFNGR1/IFNGR2` receptor complex.  
- Receptor engagement activates JAK1/JAK2 → STAT1 phosphorylation → transcription of IFN‑γ‑stimulated genes (ISGs).  
- Secondary signaling includes PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, modulating cell survival and cytokine production.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In the lung, promotes recruitment of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, aiding viral clearance.  
- In the CNS, can induce neuroinflammation by activating microglia.  
- In bone marrow, stimulates erythroid progenitor maturation and iron metabolism via hepcidin induction.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Synergizes with `IL‑12` and `IL‑18` to amplify Th1 responses.  
- Counteracts `IL‑4` and `IL‑10` by inhibiting Th2 differentiation.  
- Induces `TNF‑α` and `IL‑1β` production, amplifying inflammatory cascades.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in the `IFNG` promoter (e.g., −200G > A) modulate transcriptional activity and disease susceptibility.  
- Copy‑number variations of the `IFNG` locus correlate with autoimmune disease risk.  
- Loss‑of‑function mutations in `IFNG` or `IFNGR1/GR2` cause Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega‑3) down‑regulate `IFN‑γ` production.  
- Vitamin D supplementation suppresses `IFN‑γ` transcription via VDR binding to the promoter.  
- Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke elevates circulating `IFN‑γ` levels, contributing to airway inflammation.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Overproduction implicated in type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus.  
- In COVID‑19, excessive `IFN‑γ` contributes to cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress.  
- Low levels are associated with impaired clearance of intracellular pathogens (e.g., *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*).

### Clinical Biomarkers
- Serum `IFN‑γ` measured by ELISA is used to assess immune competence and monitor cytokine storm in infectious or autoimmune conditions.

### Therapeutic Relevance
- Recombinant `IFN‑γ` (e.g., rIFN‑γ‑1a) is FDA‑approved for chronic granulomatous disease and severe atopic dermatitis.  
- Neutralizing antibodies or JAK inhibitors (e.g., ruxolitinib) target downstream signaling in IFN‑γ‑mediated disorders.
