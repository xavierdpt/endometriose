**T‑cell subsets** are distinct populations of mature T lymphocytes differentiated by surface markers, transcriptional profiles, and functional roles. They mediate cellular immunity, helper functions, cytotoxic responses, and immune regulation, and are central to host defense, autoimmunity, and immunotherapy.  

---

## 2. Location & Context
- Peripheral blood, lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes), thymus (mature stages).  
- Variable frequencies: naive T cells (~50 %), memory T cells (~30 %), regulatory T cells (~5 %), effector T cells (~10 %).

## 3. Classification & Structure
- **Naïve** (`CD45RA+ CD62L+`) – antigen‑unexperienced.  
- **Memory** (`CD45RO+`) – subdivided into central memory (`CCR7+`) and effector memory (`CCR7-`).  
- **Effector** – cytotoxic (`CD8+`, perforin, granzyme) and helper (`CD4+` subsets).  
- **Regulatory** (`CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+`).  
- **Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh** – defined by cytokine signatures and master transcription factors.

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Helper T cells** orchestrate B‑cell activation, macrophage priming, and cytokine milieu shaping.  
- **Cytotoxic T lymphocytes** kill infected or malignant cells via perforin/granzyme and Fas/FasL pathways.  
- **Regulatory T cells** suppress excessive immune responses and maintain tolerance.  
- **Follicular helper T cells** aid germinal‑center reactions and high‑affinity antibody production.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing of transcription factors (e.g., `FOXP3` variants) can alter regulatory capacity.  
- Post‑translational modifications of TCR signaling molecules (phosphorylation of `CD3ζ`, ubiquitination of `Lck`) fine‑tune activation thresholds.

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- T‑cell activation triggers a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) to support rapid proliferation and effector functions.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Antigen recognition via the TCR complex (`αβ` or `γδ` chains).  
- Co‑stimulators: `CD28` (positive), `CTLA‑4`, `PD‑1` (negative).  
- Downstream cascades: NFAT, NF‑κB, AP‑1 → cytokine gene transcription.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Central nervous system**: Tregs limit neuroinflammation; Th17 cells contribute to multiple sclerosis.  
- **Gut mucosa**: Th17/Treg balance regulates barrier integrity and microbiota composition.  
- **Tumor microenvironment**: Tumor‑infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) reflect anti‑tumor effector activity or exhaustion.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cytokines: `IL‑2` (proliferation), `IFN‑γ` (macrophage activation), `IL‑4/IL‑13` (B‑cell class switching), `IL‑17` (neutrophil recruitment), `TGF‑β` (Treg differentiation).  
- Chemokine receptors (`CXCR5` on Tfh, `CCR5` on Th1) guide tissue homing.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- HLA alleles influence peptide presentation and T‑cell repertoire skewing.  
- TCR Vβ gene rearrangements determine antigen specificity diversity.  
- Polymorphisms in `FOXP3`, `CTLA‑4`, `PDCD1` affect regulatory function and susceptibility to autoimmunity.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Gut microbiota metabolites (short‑chain fatty acids) promote Treg induction.  
- Vitamin D and omega‑3 fatty acids modulate cytokine profiles of T‑cell subsets.  
- Chronic infections and viral antigens shape memory and exhaustion phenotypes.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Aberrant Th1/Th17 responses in type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis; Treg deficiencies in systemic lupus erythematosus.  
- **Infectious diseases**: CD8+ T‑cell exhaustion in chronic viral infections (HIV, HBV).  
- **Cancer**: TIL composition predicts prognosis; tumor escape via PD‑1/PD‑L1 mediated T‑cell inhibition.  
- **Immunodeficiencies**: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) impairs T‑cell development; CTLA‑4 haploinsufficiency leads to immune dysregulation.

### Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- Flow cytometry panels for `CD4/CD8`, `CD45RA/RO`, `CCR7`, `FOXP3`.  
- Functional assays: cytokine production (ELISpot), cytotoxicity (51 Cr release).

### Therapeutic Relevance
- **Checkpoint blockade** (`anti‑PD‑1`, `anti‑CTLA‑4`) rejuvenates exhausted T cells in oncology.  
- **Adoptive T‑cell therapy** (CAR‑T, TCR‑T) harnesses cytotoxic subsets for targeted treatment.  
- **Treg expansion** strategies (IL‑2/anti‑IL‑2 complexes, rapamycin) aim to ameliorate autoimmunity.
