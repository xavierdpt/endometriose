**Thyrotropin‑releasing hormone (TRH)** is a 3‑amino‑acid neuropeptide produced mainly in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. It activates the anterior pituitary to secrete thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin, thereby regulating thyroid hormone production and influencing a wide range of neuroendocrine processes.

### 2. Location & Context
- Synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.  
- Released into the hypothalamic‑pituitary portal system; low‑level peripheral presence in plasma.  
- Peak expression during sleep and early morning; modulated by circadian rhythm.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Family:** Tripeptide releasing hormones.  
- **Sequence:** `pGlu-His-Pro-NH₂` (pyroglutamyl‑histidyl‑proline amide).  
- Contains an N‑terminal pyroglutamate and a C‑terminal amide critical for receptor binding.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Stimulates secretion of `TSH` and `prolactin`.  
- Modulates sleep‑wake cycle, appetite, and thermoregulation via hypothalamic circuits.  
- Contributes to the negative feedback loop of thyroid hormone regulation.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Clinically used analogs: `[Tyr^2]‑TRH`, `[D-Tyr^2]‑TRH`, `[Ala^2]‑TRH`.  
- Post‑translational modifications: N‑terminal pyroglutamylation; C‑terminal amidation.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Degraded primarily by **TRHase** (prolyl oligopeptidase) into `pGlu-His`.  
- Further cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidases yields inactive fragments.  
- Excreted renally; plasma half‑life ~2 min.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds Gq‑coupled receptors `TRHR1` and `TRHR2`.  
- Activates PLC → IP₃/DAG → Ca²⁺ influx and MAPK cascade → hormone release.  
- Receptor desensitization mediated by GRKs and β‑arrestins.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Anterior pituitary:** drives `TSH` and `prolactin` secretion.  
- **Hypothalamus:** regulates sleep, feeding, and stress responses.  
- **Peripheral tissues:** modest vasodilatory and inotropic effects on myocardium; influences glucose metabolism.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Dopamine** antagonizes TRH release (inhibitory control).  
- Thyroid hormones (`T3`, `T4`) exert negative feedback on hypothalamic TRH synthesis.  
- Interacts with appetite regulators such as `ghrelin` and `leptin`.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Variants in the `TRHR1` gene (e.g., `c.1026G>A`) affect TSH response to TRH stimulation tests.  
- Rare TRH promoter polymorphisms associated with altered serum TRH levels in neuroendocrine disorders.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Iodine intake** modulates the TRH–TSH–thyroid hormone axis.  
- **Stress** and **sleep deprivation** increase hypothalamic TRH release.  
- **Thyroid‑inhibiting medications** (e.g., lithium) can raise TRH levels.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Hypothalamic or pituitary disease**: TRH levels rise when `TSH` is deficient.  
- **Pituitary adenomas**: TRH stimulation test differentiates functional status.  
- Elevated TRH implicated in **depression** and **sleep disorders**; low TRH linked to hypothyroidism and pituitary insufficiency.
