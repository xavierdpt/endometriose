**Th2/Th17 Dominance**  
Th2/Th17 dominance describes an immunologic imbalance in which cytokine networks favor both Th2‑associated (IL‑4, IL‑5, IL‑13) and Th17‑associated (IL‑17A/F, IL‑22) effector pathways. This dual skewing promotes a pro‑inflammatory milieu that contributes to chronic allergic, autoimmune, and infectious disorders. It is characterized by elevated circulating cytokines, altered transcription factor expression, and a shift in CD4⁺ T‑cell phenotypes.

### 2. Location & Context
- Primarily observed in peripheral blood CD4⁺ T cells and affected mucosal tissues (e.g., lungs, gut, skin).  
- Cytokines and transcription factors are measurable in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and local tissue biopsies.  
- Often detected in patients with atopic dermatitis, severe asthma, or inflammatory bowel disease.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Functional subset of CD4⁺ T helper cells defined by co‑expression of Th2 (GATA3) and Th17 (RORγt) transcription factors.  
- No distinct protein or lipid structures; classification is based on cytokine profiles.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Normal role: coordinate humoral immunity (Th2) and neutrophil recruitment/antimicrobial defense (Th17).  
- In dominance, excessive IL‑4/IL‑13 induces IgE production and airway hyperreactivity, while IL‑17/IL‑22 drives neutrophilic inflammation and epithelial barrier disruption.

### 5. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cross‑talk with innate sensors: TLR activation enhances Th17 skewing; IL‑25 and IL‑33 favor Th2 differentiation.  
- Cytokine synergy: IL‑21 supports Th17 expansion; IL‑6 and IL‑1β act as key polarizing signals.  
- Regulatory networks: TGF‑β is required for Th17 differentiation but also promotes Th2 under high IL‑4 conditions.

### 6. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in *IL4*, *IL13*, and *IL17A* genes correlate with susceptibility to atopic dermatitis and asthma.  
- Variants in *STAT6* (Th2 pathway) and *STAT3* (Th17 pathway) influence cytokine responsiveness.  
- Copy‑number variations in *RORC* may affect Th17 differentiation.

### 7. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Vitamin D deficiency skews towards Th17 dominance; supplementation can dampen IL‑17 production.  
- Western diets high in saturated fats and processed sugars promote Th2/Th17 skewing through gut microbiota alterations.  
- Exposure to pollutants (e.g., diesel exhaust, ozone) enhances IL‑17 responses.

### 8. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Allergic diseases**: Severe asthma, atopic dermatitis, nasal polyps.  
- **Autoimmune disorders**: Psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis.  
- **Infectious complications**: Increased susceptibility to fungal and bacterial infections due to impaired neutrophil function.  
- Biomarkers: Elevated serum IL‑4, IL‑13, IL‑17A, and IL‑22; increased GATA3⁺/RORγt⁺ double‑positive T cells.

### 9. Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- Flow cytometry: GATA3⁺/RORγt⁺ CD4⁺ T‑cell frequency.  
- ELISA or multiplex cytokine panels for IL‑4, IL‑13, IL‑17A, IL‑22.  
- Serum IgE levels and eosinophil counts reflect Th2 activity.

### 10. Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- **Biologic agents**: Dupilumab (anti‑IL‑4Rα) reduces Th2 signaling; secukinumab (anti‑IL‑17A) targets Th17 activity.  
- **Small molecules**: JAK inhibitors dampen downstream STAT signaling of both pathways.  
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Vitamin D repletion, dietary modification, and smoking cessation mitigate cytokine imbalance.

### 11. Molecular Pathways
- Th2: IL‑4/IL‑13 → IL‑4Rα/IL‑13Rα1 → STAT6 → GATA3.  
- Th17: IL‑6/IL‑1β + TGF‑β → STAT3 → RORγt.  
- Co‑activation can lead to synergistic STAT3/STAT6 signaling, amplifying inflammatory outputs.
