**Systemic low‑grade inflammation** is a chronic, low‑intensity activation of the innate immune system that persists over weeks to months. It is characterized by modest elevations of circulating pro‑inflammatory cytokines and acute‑phase proteins, and it contributes to the development of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Circulates in the bloodstream and affects multiple organs (heart, liver, adipose, skeletal muscle, brain).  
- Baseline cytokine levels are sub‑threshold for acute inflammation but above normal resting values (e.g., serum `IL‑6` ≈ 2–5 pg mL⁻¹).

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Category: **Chronic, low‑intensity inflammatory status**.  
- Subtypes: metabolic (e.g., obesity‑related), age‑related (inflammaging), post‑traumatic, and lifestyle‑driven.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Maintains basal immune surveillance and tissue remodeling.  
- Promotes metabolic adaptations (e.g., insulin resistance, altered lipid handling).  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Key mediators: `IL‑6`, `TNF‑α`, `IL‑1β`, `CRP`, `sTNFR`.  
- Post‑translational modifications of cytokines (e.g., O‑glycosylation of `IL‑6` enhances receptor affinity).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Cytokine production largely from activated macrophages, adipocytes, and endothelial cells.  
- Acute‑phase proteins (e.g., `CRP`) are synthesized by hepatocytes under `IL‑6` stimulation.  
- Clearance of cytokines involves proteolytic degradation and receptor‑mediated endocytosis.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- `IL‑6` → `IL‑6R`/`gp130` → JAK/STAT3 and MAPK pathways.  
- `TNF‑α` → TNFR1/TNFR2 → NF‑κB, MAPK, and apoptosis cascades.  
- `IL‑1β` → IL‑1R1 → MyD88‑dependent NF‑κB activation.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Adipose**: promotes lipolysis, leptin resistance, and macrophage recruitment.  
- **Liver**: induces acute‑phase protein synthesis and steatosis.  
- **Skeletal muscle**: reduces insulin signaling via serine phosphorylation of IRS‑1.  
- **Brain**: increases blood–brain barrier permeability and microglial activation.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Interacts with insulin, leptin, and adiponectin signaling pathways.  
- Cross‑talk with oxidative stress (ROS) amplifies NF‑κB activity.  
- Modulates lipid metabolism through peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptors (PPARs).

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `IL6` promoter SNP rs1800795 (−174 G>C) associated with higher cytokine levels and cardiovascular risk.  
- `TNFA` promoter polymorphisms (e.g., –308 G>A) correlate with increased `TNF‑α` production.  
- Variants in `CRP` gene affect baseline protein concentration.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- High intake of saturated fats and refined sugars → ↑ cytokine production.  
- Omega‑3 fatty acids and polyphenols → ↓ inflammatory markers.  
- Chronic stress and sleep deprivation → ↑ cortisol resistance and cytokine release.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic kidney disease.  
- Biomarker profile: elevated `CRP`, ESR, `IL‑6`, `TNF‑α`, and fibrinogen.

### Optional Sections

#### Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- High‑sensitivity `CRP` (hs‑CRP), ESR, serum `IL‑6`, and `TNF‑α` levels.  

#### Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- Lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise).  
- Statins and ACE inhibitors lower inflammatory markers.  
- Anti‑TNF therapies (adalimumab) and IL‑6R antagonists (tocilizumab) used in refractory cases.  

#### Molecular Pathways
- **NF‑κB pathway**: central regulator of pro‑inflammatory gene transcription.  
- **JAK/STAT3 signaling**: mediates `IL‑6`‑driven acute‑phase responses.  
- **MAPK cascade**: modulates cytokine production and cell survival.
