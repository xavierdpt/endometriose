**Anterior pituitary cortisol‑resistant state**

This rare endocrine disorder is defined by a failure of the anterior pituitary corticotrophs to respond to the negative feedback exerted by circulating cortisol. The resistance leads to persistently elevated ACTH and subsequent hyper‑adrenocorticism, causing systemic metabolic disturbances. The condition is typically diagnosed by the absence of suppression in low‑dose dexamethasone tests despite high cortisol levels.

### 2. Location & Context
- Predominantly affects corticotroph cells in the **anterior pituitary**.
- Normal function relies on **glucocorticoid receptors (GR)**; in the resistant state GR signaling is impaired.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Classified as an **endocrine feedback disorder** within the spectrum of pituitary dysfunctions.
- Involves alterations in the **NR3C1** gene product, the GR protein.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Cortisol normally binds GR, down‑regulating CRH‑induced ACTH synthesis.
- In resistance, this negative feedback loop is blunted, leading to unchecked ACTH secretion and adrenal hyperplasia.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Not applicable (no distinct analogs or isoforms).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Not applicable.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Impaired GR ligand‑binding or nuclear translocation; may involve post‑translational modifications that reduce DNA binding affinity.
- Possible loss‑of‑function mutations in `NR3C1`.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Primary effect on corticotrophs; secondary systemic impact includes heightened cortisol action on liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle tissues.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Aberrant interaction with CRH, POMC, and ACTH signaling cascades.
- Possible dysregulation of mineralocorticoid receptor activity due to altered cortisol levels.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Mutations in `NR3C1` (e.g., R484P, N363S) linked to reduced GR sensitivity.
- Polymorphisms in `11β-HSD2` may exacerbate cortisol exposure at the pituitary level.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Chronic exogenous glucocorticoid use can potentiate resistance.
- Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, and high‑salt diets may worsen feedback impairment.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Clinical features mirror Cushing syndrome: central obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, skin thinning.
- Diagnostic hallmark: failure of cortisol suppression in low‑dose dexamethasone suppression test; serum ACTH remains elevated.

#### Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests
- Elevated serum/urine cortisol and ACTH.
- Low‑dose dexamethasone suppression test failure.

#### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting
- Glucocorticoid antagonists (e.g., mifepristone) to block GR action.
- Targeted pituitary radiosurgery or somatostatin analogs to reduce ACTH production.
