**Th17 Cells**

Th17 cells are a distinct subset of CD4⁺ T helper cells that produce the signature cytokine interleukin‑17A (IL‑17A). They are pivotal in mucosal immunity and play key roles in host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. However, dysregulated Th17 responses contribute to a range of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Primarily reside in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes) and peripheral tissues such as the gut mucosa and skin.  
- Express surface markers CD4⁺, CCR6⁺, and IL‑23R⁺; low to moderate abundance relative to Th1/Th2 cells.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Classified within the CD4⁺ T helper lineage, distinct from Th1, Th2, and Treg cells.  
- Defined by transcription factor RORγt, which drives IL‑17A/IL‑17F expression; also express BATF and IRF4.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Produce IL‑17A, IL‑17F, IL‑21, and IL‑22, recruiting neutrophils and inducing antimicrobial peptides.  
- Maintain epithelial barrier integrity and coordinate immune responses at mucosal surfaces.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- IL‑17A signals through the heterodimeric receptor complex IL‑17RA/IL‑17RC, activating ACT1‑dependent NF‑κB and MAPK pathways.  
- IL‑23 and IL‑1β are key cytokines for Th17 differentiation and expansion via STAT3 phosphorylation.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In the gut, Th17 cells regulate antimicrobial peptide production and support IgA class switching.  
- In skin, they promote keratinocyte proliferation and secrete IL‑22, contributing to psoriasis pathogenesis.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cross‑talk with innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) through shared cytokines (IL‑17, IL‑22).  
- Modulate dendritic cell maturation via IL‑23 production; respond to microbiota‑derived metabolites like short‑chain fatty acids.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Polymorphisms in the *IL23R* gene (e.g., R381Q) are associated with altered Th17 function and risk for Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  
- Variants in *RORC* (encoding RORγt) influence Th17 differentiation and autoimmune susceptibility.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- High‑fat diets can enhance Th17 responses via altered gut microbiota composition.  
- Vitamin D deficiency downregulates RORγt, reducing Th17 differentiation and impacting mucosal immunity.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Overactive Th17 responses contribute to autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease.  
- Th17 signatures serve as biomarkers for disease activity and therapeutic response in these conditions.
