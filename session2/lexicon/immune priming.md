**Immune priming** is a conserved biological strategy by which a prior exposure to a pathogen, toxin, or immunogenic stimulus enhances the speed, magnitude, or quality of subsequent immune responses. This process is central to both innate and adaptive immunity and underlies phenomena such as trained immunity, cross‑reactive T‑cell memory, and vaccine efficacy.

### 2. Location & Context
- Occurs systemically across the immune system and at the level of individual cells (macrophages, NK cells, B cells, T cells).  
- Priming agents are found in the extracellular environment (pathogen‑associated molecular patterns, cytokines) or within intracellular compartments (endosomes, cytosol).  
- The magnitude of priming correlates with the concentration and duration of the priming stimulus.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Functional class:** Biological “memory” mechanism.  
- **Categories:**  
  - *Innate immune priming* (trained immunity) – epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate cells.  
  - *Adaptive immune priming* – antigen‑specific T and B cell activation and differentiation.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Accelerates and amplifies effector responses upon re‑exposure, reducing pathogen replication and disease severity.  
- Induces a “ready‑state” in innate cells, enhancing cytokine production (`TNF‑α`, `IL‑6`), phagocytosis, and antimicrobial peptide release.  
- In adaptive immunity, drives clonal expansion, affinity maturation, and long‑lasting memory cell pools.

### 5. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs):** `TLR4`, `NOD2`, `STING` initiate priming signals.  
- **Cytokines and chemokines:** `IL‑1β`, `IL‑18`, `IFN‑γ` modulate the primed phenotype.  
- **Epigenetic modifiers:** Histone acetyltransferases (`p300`), methyltransferases (`SETD7`) remodel chromatin in trained cells.

### 6. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Microbial exposure:** Gut microbiota metabolites (short‑chain fatty acids) can prime intestinal immune cells.  
- **Nutritional status:** Vitamins (A, D, C) and micronutrients (zinc, selenium) influence priming efficiency.  
- **Environmental toxins:** Chronic low‑dose endotoxin exposure can induce innate immune tolerance rather than priming.

### 7. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Enhanced protection:** Vaccination and prior infection confer rapid, robust immunity.  
- **Immunopathology:** Excessive priming may drive hyperinflammatory conditions (e.g., cytokine storm in severe viral infections).  
- **Autoimmunity:** Aberrant priming of self‑reactive lymphocytes can contribute to disease onset.

### 8. Molecular Pathways
- **Innate priming:** `TLR` → `NF‑κB` → epigenetic remodeling → heightened transcription of pro‑inflammatory genes.  
- **Adaptive priming:** `Antigen` + `co‑stimulation` (`CD28`) → `PI3K/AKT` → metabolic reprogramming → clonal expansion.
