**Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)**  
ACTH is a 39‑residue peptide produced by the anterior pituitary that orchestrates the stress response by stimulating cortisol production from the adrenal cortex. It is synthesized as a prohormone (pro‑ACTH) and cleaved to yield the mature hormone and smaller peptides such as α‑MSH and vasopressin. ACTH plays a central role in the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) axis and is a key biomarker for adrenal function.

### 2. Location & Context
- Synthesized in corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary and released into systemic circulation.  
- Peak plasma concentrations occur during the circadian rhythm, with a nadir at night.  
- In the bloodstream, ACTH is largely free but can be bound to carrier proteins such as corticosteroid‑binding globulin.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Peptide hormone of the *glycoprotein hormone* family; related to other pituitary hormones via shared processing pathways.  
- Linear 39‑mer with an N‑terminal pyroglutamic acid residue and a C‑terminal lysine–arginine motif.  
- Rich in proline and glycine residues, giving a flexible backbone conducive to receptor binding.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Primary stimulator of adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis (cortisol, corticosterone).  
- Activates the adrenal zona fasciculata and zona reticularis via the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R).  
- Modulates metabolic processes, immune responses, and the circadian regulation of cortisol.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Pro‑ACTH (1–39) precursor; cleavage by prohormone convertase 1/3 yields ACTH, α‑MSH, and β‑endorphin.  
- C‑terminal ACTH(18–39) fragment (α‑MSH) and N‑terminal ACTH(1–8) fragment have distinct melanogenic activities.  
- Post‑translational modifications: N‑terminal pyroglutamic acid; glycine amidation in related peptides.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Cleavage from pro‑ACTH occurs in secretory granules via prohormone convertase 1/3.  
- Degraded primarily by the adrenal gland and liver via peptidases such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP‑IV).  
- Clearance rate: half‑life ~8–15 min in plasma.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) on adrenal cortical cells.  
- MC2R activation triggers Gs‑protein → adenylate cyclase → ↑cAMP → PKA activation → transcription of steroidogenic enzymes.  
- Non‑canonical signaling (e.g., β‑arrestin recruitment) may modulate receptor desensitization.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Adrenal cortex:** upregulates enzymes CYP11B1, CYP17A1, and HSD3B2, enhancing cortisol and androgen production.  
- **Immune cells:** acts as an anti‑inflammatory mediator by increasing IL‑10 and decreasing pro‑inflammatory cytokines.  
- **Central nervous system:** influences mood, anxiety, and neuroendocrine feedback loops via melanocortin receptors in the hypothalamus.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Negative feedback from cortisol suppresses hypothalamic CRH and pituitary ACTH secretion.  
- Interacts with β‑endorphin and α‑MSH to modulate skin pigmentation and analgesia.  
- Cortisol binds corticosteroid‑binding globulin (CBG), indirectly modulating ACTH bioavailability.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in the *POMC* gene (encoding pro‑ACTH) affect hormone production; e.g., -347C/T influences basal ACTH levels.  
- Variants in the *MC2R* gene can cause familial glucocorticoid deficiency, leading to ACTH‑resistant adrenal failure.  
- Polymorphisms in the CRH and CRH‑binding protein genes alter ACTH secretion dynamics.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Glucocorticoid‑inducing stressors (caffeine, nicotine, high‑fat diets) elevate ACTH secretion.  
- Chronic sleep deprivation blunts circadian peaks, reducing ACTH variability.  
- Environmental pollutants such as bisphenol A can disrupt HPA axis regulation, altering ACTH rhythms.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Cushing’s disease:** pituitary adenomas secrete excess ACTH, leading to hypercortisolism.  
- **Addison’s disease:** adrenal insufficiency causes compensatory rise in ACTH, measurable via ACTH stimulation tests.  
- **Addisonian crisis:** acute ACTH surge due to sudden cortisol deficiency.  
- **Chronic fatigue syndrome:** dysregulated ACTH rhythms correlate with symptom severity.
