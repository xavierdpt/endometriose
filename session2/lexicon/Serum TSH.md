**Serum TSH** is the circulating form of the glycoprotein hormone that regulates thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. It is secreted by the anterior pituitary into the bloodstream, where its concentration reflects the activity of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑thyroid axis. Clinical measurement of serum TSH is the most sensitive and widely used screening test for thyroid dysfunction.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- Found exclusively in the extracellular fluid; measurable in serum and plasma.  
- Typical reference range: **0.4–4.0 mIU/L** (varies by assay and population).  
- Produced by the corticotroph‑like cells of the anterior pituitary in response to thyrotropin‑releasing hormone (TRH).

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Glycoprotein hormone belonging to the **glycoprotein hormone family** (α‑subunit shared with LH, FSH, CG).  
- Heterodimer of an α‑subunit (~92 aa) and a β‑subunit (~110 aa) linked by a disulfide bridge; both subunits are N‑glycosylated.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Binds the TSH receptor (TSHR) on thyroid follicular cells, stimulating the production of T4 and T3.  
- Indirectly influences metabolism, growth, and development through thyroid hormone release.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Intact intact TSH; “free” TSH fragments can appear in disease states.  
- Recombinant TSH (rhTSH) is available for therapeutic use in radioiodine uptake imaging.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Clearance occurs mainly via hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.  
- Endogenous TSH is degraded in the bloodstream, with a half‑life of ~20 min.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **TSHR** (G protein‑coupled receptor) → activates Gs → ↑cAMP → PKA activation → thyroid hormone synthesis.  
- Non‑genomic actions are limited and not well characterised.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- Primarily acts on the thyroid gland.  
- Modest stimulatory effects reported on bone, adipose tissue, and pituitary thyrotrophs.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Iodine, selenium, and other trace elements modulate thyroid hormone synthesis downstream of TSH.  
- Thyroid‑binding globulin (TBG) regulates circulating T4/T3 but does not directly bind TSH.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- **TSHR** polymorphisms (e.g., rs179247, rs12101255) influence TSH levels and thyroid disease risk.  
- **TSHB** variants can affect β‑subunit expression and secretion.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Adequate iodine intake is essential; deficiency lowers TSH due to reduced thyroid hormone feedback.  
- Selenium status and goitrogenic substances (e.g., thiocyanate) alter TSH dynamics.  
- Certain drugs (e.g., lithium, amiodarone) elevate serum TSH.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Hypothyroidism**: ↑TSH with low T4/T3.  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: ↓TSH with high T4/T3.  
- **Subclinical thyroid disease**: abnormal TSH with normal peripheral hormones.  
- **Pituitary adenomas**: can cause inappropriate TSH secretion.  
- **Pregnancy**: physiological TSH changes; screening recommended early in gestation.

### 13. Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests  
- Quantitative immunoassays (chemiluminescent, ELISA, electrochemiluminescence).  
- Reference ranges adjusted for age, sex, pregnancy, and assay platform.  
- Used for screening of thyroid disorders, monitoring of thyroid replacement therapy, and pre‑operative assessment.

### 14. Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting  
- Recombinant TSH (rhTSH) employed to stimulate residual thyroid tissue for radioiodine imaging or therapy.  
- TSHR antagonists are being investigated for treatment of Graves’ disease but are not yet clinically available.
