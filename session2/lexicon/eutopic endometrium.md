The **eutopic endometrium** is the normal, in‑uterus lining of the uterus that undergoes cyclical remodeling during the menstrual cycle. It provides the receptive environment for embryo implantation and supports early pregnancy. Its dynamic regulation by ovarian steroid hormones makes it a key model for studying hormonal responsiveness and reproductive health.

### 2. Location & Context
- **Tissue:** Intrauterine lining of the uterus.  
- **Cellular components:** Glandular epithelium, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells.  
- **Abundance:** Thickness varies from ~1 mm (menstrual phase) to ~7 mm (secretory phase) in women of reproductive age.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Layers:**  
  - *Functional layer*: outer, hormonally responsive, shed during menses.  
  - *Basal layer*: inner, regenerative, contains stem/progenitor cells.  
- **Key structures:** Endometrial glands, stromal decidual cells (in secretory phase), spiral arterioles.  
- **Morphology:** Glandular epithelium displays pseudostratified columnar cells with varying secretory activity.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Menstrual cycle regulation:** Responds to estrogen (proliferation) and progesterone (secretory differentiation).  
- **Implantation support:** Provides decidualized stromal matrix, vascular remodeling, and immune tolerance for the embryo.  
- **Menstrual shedding:** Apoptosis‑mediated sloughing of functional layer during menstruation.

### 5. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Proliferative phase:** Estrogen‐driven mitogenesis of epithelial and stromal cells.  
- **Secretory phase:** Progesterone‑induced synthesis of glycodelin, LIF, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  
- **Decidualization:** Stromal fibroblasts transdifferentiate into large, lipid‑laden decidual cells critical for placental attachment.

### 6. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Hormonal crosstalk:**  
  - Estrogen receptor `ERα`/`ERβ` activate cyclin‑dependent kinases.  
  - Progesterone receptor `PR-A`/`PR-B` mediate anti‑proliferative and secretory genes.  
- **Growth factors:** `IGF‑1`, `EGF`, and `HGF` modulate proliferation and angiogenesis.  
- **Immune mediators:** `IL‑1β`, `IL‑6`, and `TNF‑α` shape the local immune milieu during implantation.

### 7. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- **HOXA10** and **HOXA11** variants correlate with implantation failure.  
- Polymorphisms in `PGR` and `ESR1` influence endometrial receptivity and thickness.  
- Copy‑number variations in `VEGF` gene loci affect angiogenic capacity.

### 8. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Endometrial hyperplasia**: Excess proliferation leading to potential carcinoma.  
- **Endometrial carcinoma**: Dysregulated cell cycle checkpoints, often associated with estrogen excess.  
- **Adenomyosis**: Endometrial glands infiltrate myometrium, causing dysmenorrhea.  
- **Subclinical endometrial dysfunction**: Can manifest as infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss.
