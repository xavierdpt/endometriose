**Bile acids** are amphipathic steroid molecules derived from cholesterol that play essential roles in lipid digestion, cholesterol homeostasis, and signaling pathways regulating metabolism and inflammation. They are synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the intestine where they emulsify dietary fats. Their dysregulation contributes to liver disease, metabolic syndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders.  

### 1. Introductory Summary  
Bile acids are steroid acids produced from cholesterol in hepatocytes, secreted into bile, and reabsorbed in the ileum. They are critical for emulsifying dietary lipids and serve as signaling molecules that modulate metabolism, immune function, and gut microbiota.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- Synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the duodenum.  
- Reabsorbed in the terminal ileum via the apical sodium‑dependent bile acid transporter (`ASBT`).  
- Present at millimolar concentrations in bile; micromolar in plasma.  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Classified as primary (e.g., cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid) and secondary (e.g., deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) bile acids.  
- Core structure: 4‑ring steroid nucleus with hydroxyl groups at C3, C7, and C12 (primary) or with fewer hydroxyls (secondary).  
- Conjugation with glycine or taurine increases solubility.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Facilitate micelle formation for lipid digestion and absorption.  
- Act as endogenous ligands for nuclear receptor `FXR` and GPCRs (`TGR5`, `S1PR2`).  
- Regulate bile acid synthesis via feedback inhibition of `CYP7A1`.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Conjugated forms: glyco‑ and tauro‑conjugates (e.g., taurocholic acid).  
- Oxidized metabolites: 7‑hydroxy‑4‑methyl-3‑oxo‑... (e.g., 7‑α‑hydroxy‑4‑methyl-3‑oxo-5,6‑unsaturated).  
- Microbiota‑produced secondary bile acids via 7‑α‑dehydroxylation.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Primary synthesis via `CYP7A1` (classic pathway) and `CYP27A1` (alternative).  
- Conjugation by `BAAT` (bile acid‑CoA:amino acid N‑acyltransferase).  
- Deconjugation by gut bacterial bile salt hydrolases; dehydroxylation by 7‑α‑dehydroxylating bacteria.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- `FXR` (nuclear) → regulates bile acid synthesis, lipid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis.  
- `TGR5` (GPCR) → stimulates GLP‑1 release, energy expenditure, and anti‑inflammatory effects.  
- `S1PR2` → mediates vascular integrity and immune cell trafficking.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Liver**: regulates cholesterol catabolism, lipid metabolism, and xenobiotic detoxification.  
- **Intestine**: modulates mucosal barrier, microbiota composition, and enteroendocrine hormone secretion.  
- **Pancreas**: influences insulin sensitivity via `TGR5`.  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Binds to transporters: `NTCP`, `OATP`, and `ASBT`.  
- Modulates signaling of PPARα, LXR, and SREBP‑2.  
- Interacts with gut microbiota, influencing short‑chain fatty acid production.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- `CYP7A1` promoter SNPs affect bile acid synthesis and cholesterol levels.  
- Variants in `ABCB11` (bile salt export pump) linked to intrahepatic cholestasis.  
- `FXR` polymorphisms associated with non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease risk.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- High‑fat diet increases bile acid secretion and modifies bile acid pool composition.  
- Dietary fibers and prebiotics alter microbiota‑mediated bile acid transformation.  
- Drugs such as rifampicin, cholestyramine, and bile acid sequestrants modify enterohepatic circulation.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Cholestatic liver diseases (e.g., primary sclerosing cholangitis) feature impaired bile acid transport.  
- Metabolic syndrome: elevated secondary bile acids contribute to insulin resistance.  
- Gallstone disease: supersaturation of cholesterol and hydrophobic bile acids precipitate stones.  
- Inflammatory bowel disease: altered bile acid signaling affects mucosal immunity.  

### Therapeutic Relevance  
- **Ursodeoxycholic acid**: hydrophilic bile acid used to dissolve gallstones and treat cholestasis.  
- **Obeticholic acid**: synthetic `FXR` agonist approved for primary biliary cholangitis.  
- Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine) lower LDL cholesterol by interrupting enterohepatic circulation.  

### Clinical Biomarkers  
- Serum total bile acids, conjugated bile acids, and 7‑α‑hydroxy‑4‑methyl‑3‑oxo‑chol-4‑ene (7‑α‑OH‑CA) as markers of cholestasis.  
- Fecal bile acid profiling informs gut microbiota alterations.
