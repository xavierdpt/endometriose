Free T3 (triiodothyronine) is the active metabolite of thyroid hormone that directly modulates transcription in target tissues. It is generated primarily from the deiodination of thyroxine (T4) and circulates in both protein‑bound and unbound (free) forms, with the free fraction being biologically active. Its actions influence basal metabolic rate, development, and numerous physiological processes throughout the body.

## 2. Location & Context
- **Serum**: ~5–15 % free, ~90 % albumin‑bound, ~5 % transthyretin‑bound.  
- **Intracellular**: diffuses into nucleus via thyroid hormone transporters (e.g., `SLC16A2`); also retained in cytoplasm.  
- **Typical concentration**: 1–4 pmol L⁻¹ in healthy adults, varies with age, pregnancy, and disease.

## 3. Classification & Structure
- **Classification**: Small organic hormone; member of the iodothyronine family.  
- **Structure**: Aromatic ring system with three iodine atoms (positions 3, 5, 3′) and a phenolic side chain; `C₁₀H₁₁I₃NO₄`.  
- **Key motifs**: Thyroxine-binding pocket; `R(3,3′)` and `R(3,5)` iodination sites.

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Metabolism**: Stimulates mitochondrial respiration and uncoupling, increases oxygen consumption.  
- **Gene regulation**: Activates nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (`TRα`, `TRβ`), modulating transcription of ~1000 target genes.  
- **Development**: Essential for neuronal differentiation and skeletal maturation.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **Primary metabolite**: `T4` → `T3` via type‑1 and type‑2 deiodinases.  
- **Inactive isomer**: Reverse T3 (rT3), formed by 5′‑deiodination of T4; antagonistic to T3 action.  
- **Post‑translational**: None (small molecule).

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- **Biosynthesis**: `I⁻` + `T4` → `T3` (via `DIO1`, `DIO2`).  
- **Degradation**: `DIO3` inactivates T3 to T2 and rT3; conjugation to glucuronides by UGTs.  
- **Transport**: `SLC16A2` (MCT8) for cellular uptake; `MCT10` and `OATP1C1` also involved.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- **Receptors**: Nuclear `TRα1`, `TRα2`, `TRβ1`, `TRβ2`; also membrane‐associated `integrin αvβ3`.  
- **Mode of action**: Genomic—binds to thyroid response elements (`TRE`) → recruits co‑activators or co‑repressors; Non‑genomic—activates MAPK, PI3K/AKT pathways via `integrin αvβ3`.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Brain**: Promotes neuronal myelination; required for normal cognition.  
- **Heart**: Increases contractility by upregulating β‑myosin heavy chain.  
- **Skeletal muscle**: Enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and fiber type transition.  
- **Adipose tissue**: Stimulates lipolysis and thermogenesis.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- **Iodine**: Essential for synthesis; deficiency reduces T3 levels.  
- **Glucocorticoids**: Synergize on gene expression; glucocorticoids can upregulate `DIO1`.  
- **Estrogens**: Modulate deiodinase activity and alter binding protein levels.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- **`THRB`** (TRβ) polymorphisms (e.g., `N312S`) alter receptor sensitivity.  
- **`DIO1`** and `DIO2` SNPs affect conversion efficiency.  
- **`SLC16A2`** variants influence cellular uptake and contribute to Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Iodine intake**: Determines substrate availability.  
- **Soy isoflavones**: May inhibit deiodinases.  
- **Medications**: `Amiodarone`, `Propylthiouracil`, `Methimazole` alter synthesis/deiodination.  
- **Stress**: Elevates cortisol, modulating `DIO1` expression.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Hypothyroidism**: Low free T3 → fatigue, cold intolerance, bradycardia.  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Elevated free T3 → weight loss, tachycardia, heat intolerance.  
- **Non‑thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)**: Suppressed free T3 in critical illness.  
- **Autoimmune thyroiditis**: Autoantibodies against `TPO` reduce iodine organification, lowering T3 production.

## Optional Sections

### Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- **Free T3 assay** (immunoassay, mass spectrometry) to assess thyroid hormone status when T4 and TSH are ambiguous.  
- **T4/T3 ratio** used to evaluate deiodination efficiency.

### Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- **Liothyronine (`T3`) therapy** for refractory hypothyroidism or to replace levothyroxine in patients with deiodinase defects.  
- **TRβ agonists** (e.g., `Sobetirome`) under investigation for dyslipidemia and non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease.
