Hepatocytes are the principal parenchymal cells of the liver, accounting for ~70 % of its mass. They execute a wide array of metabolic, synthetic, and detoxification functions essential for systemic homeostasis. Dysfunction or loss of hepatocytes underlies many acute and chronic liver diseases.

### 2. Location & Context
- Reside in the liver lobule, forming plates around the central vein and sinusoids.  
- Express high levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes, glutathione‑S‑transferases, and albumin.  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Classified as **epithelial** (hepatoblast‑derived) cells; belong to the endodermal lineage.  
- Polygonal shape with a single nucleus, abundant rough ER, numerous mitochondria, and a prominent glycogen granule.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Central to **carbohydrate metabolism**: glycogenesis, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis.  
- Major **protein synthesis** hub: albumin, clotting factors, α‑1‑antitrypsin.  
- Key **detoxification** site: phase I/II reactions, bile acid secretion.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Splice variants of the hepatocyte nuclear factor family (e.g., `HNF4α`, `HNF1α`).  
- Post‑translational modifications: phosphorylation of `STAT3`, acetylation of `NF‑κB`.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- **Phase I**: CYP3A4, CYP2E1 catalyze oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis.  
- **Phase II**: UDP‑glucuronosyltransferases, sulfotransferases conjugate substrates.  
- Co‑factor dependency: NADPH, glutathione, coenzyme A.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Express `FXR`, `TGR5`, `PPARα`, and `Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET)`.  
- Activation leads to transcriptional regulation (e.g., bile acid homeostasis) or mitogenic signaling via MAPK/PI3K pathways.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- In the liver, hepatocytes synthesize lipoproteins (`VLDL`, `HDL`).  
- In the gut–liver axis, they reabsorb portal metabolites and present antigens to Kupffer cells.  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Secrete **hepatokines**: fetuin‑A, fibroblast growth factor 21 (`FGF21`), and adiponectin‑binding protein.  
- Uptake and release of bilirubin, ammonia, and vitamins (e.g., vitamin D).  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- Variants in `PNPLA3` (I148M) predispose to non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease.  
- `TP53` and `CTNNB1` mutations are common in hepatocellular carcinoma.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- High‑fat diet elevates de novo lipogenesis; alcohol induces CYP2E1 and oxidative stress.  
- Certain xenobiotics (acetaminophen) cause dose‑dependent hepatotoxicity via reactive metabolites.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Acute liver failure**: massive apoptosis/necrosis of hepatocytes.  
- **Chronic liver disease**: fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma.  
- Biomarkers: elevated alanine aminotransferase (`ALT`), aspartate aminotransferase (`AST`), and gamma‑glutamyl transferase (`GGT`).  

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance  
- **Targeted drug delivery**: hepatocyte‑specific ligands (e.g., GalNAc conjugates) exploit `ASGPR` for RNAi therapeutics.  
- **Regenerative medicine**: hepatocyte transplantation and organoid cultures for treating inherited metabolic disorders.
