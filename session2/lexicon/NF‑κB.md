NF‑κB is a family of transcription factors that orchestrates innate and adaptive immune responses, cell survival, and inflammatory signaling. It is activated by diverse stimuli such as cytokines, microbial products, and stress signals, and drives the expression of genes involved in cytokine production, apoptosis inhibition, and immune cell differentiation. Dysregulation of NF‑κB underlies many inflammatory diseases, cancers, and autoimmune disorders.  

### 1. Introductory Summary  
- NF‑κB refers to a group of dimeric transcription factors (p65/RelA, RelB, c‑Rel, p50, p52) that bind κB DNA elements.  
- It acts as a master regulator of immune and inflammatory gene transcription.  
- Aberrant NF‑κB activity is implicated in chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumorigenesis.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- Predominantly cytoplasmic as inactive dimers complexed with IκB inhibitors.  
- Upon activation, NF‑κB rapidly translocates to the nucleus.  
- Expressed ubiquitously but levels vary with cell type (highest in immune cells).  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Rel family of transcription factors, belonging to the NF‑κB/Rel superfamily.  
- Characterized by a Rel Homology Domain (RHD) for dimerization, DNA binding, and IκB interaction; C‑terminal transactivation domains (TADs) in p65/RelA, p50, etc.  
- Canonical heterodimers (p65‑p50) and non‑canonical homodimers (p52‑p52) exist.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Induces transcription of cytokines (IL‑1, TNFα), chemokines, adhesion molecules, and anti‑apoptotic proteins (Bcl‑2, XIAP).  
- Modulates adaptive immunity by influencing T‑cell differentiation and B‑cell activation.  
- Drives cellular responses to oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Alternative splicing generates p50 (50 kDa) and p52 (52 kDa) lacking TADs.  
- Post‑translational modifications: phosphorylation (IκBα, NF‑κB subunits), ubiquitination, acetylation, SUMOylation.  
- IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε inhibit NF‑κB by masking its NLS.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- NF‑κB activity is regulated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex: IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO.  
- Canonical pathway: IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα → ubiquitination → proteasomal degradation.  
- Non‑canonical pathway: IKKα phosphorylates p100 → processing to p52.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Activated by Toll‑like receptors, cytokine receptors (TNFR, IL‑1R), and pattern‑recognition receptors (RIG‑I, NOD‑like).  
- Signals through IKK complex → IκB degradation → nuclear translocation.  
- NF‑κB functions as a transcriptional regulator, not a membrane receptor.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- In macrophages: drives pro‑inflammatory cytokine production.  
- In epithelial cells: maintains barrier integrity and induces antimicrobial peptides.  
- In neurons: modulates neuroinflammation and cell survival.  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Cross‑talk with AP‑1, STAT3, and HIF‑1α to integrate signals.  
- Interacts with co‑activators (p300/CBP) and co‑repressors (HDACs).  
- Modulated by microRNAs (miR‑146a, miR‑155) that target IκB or NF‑κB transcripts.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNPs in the promoter of *NFKBIA* (IκBα) and *NFKB1* influence susceptibility to inflammatory diseases.  
- Mutations in *IKBKG* (NEMO) cause ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency.  
- Polymorphisms in *IKBKB* (IKKβ) are linked to rheumatoid arthritis risk.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Polyphenols (curcumin, resveratrol) inhibit NF‑κB activation.  
- Saturated fatty acids enhance NF‑κB signaling via TLR4.  
- Chronic exposure to pollutants (PM₂.₅, ozone) activates NF‑κB in airway epithelium.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Chronic inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis.  
- Autoimmune disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes.  
- Cancer: constitutive NF‑κB activity promotes tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance.  
- Cardiovascular disease: NF‑κB–mediated cytokine production contributes to atherosclerosis.  

**Therapeutic relevance**  
- IKK inhibitors (BMS‑345541, MLN‑120B), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), and NF‑κB decoy oligonucleotides are in clinical development for inflammatory and malignant indications.
