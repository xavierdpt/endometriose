**Toll‑Like Receptor 4 (`TLR4`)** is a transmembrane pattern‑recognition receptor that detects lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram‑negative bacteria and a variety of endogenous danger signals.  
It initiates innate immune signaling, linking microbial recognition to downstream inflammatory and adaptive responses.  
Because of its central role in host defense and disease, `TLR4` is a key therapeutic target and biomarker in sepsis, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Expressed on the plasma membrane of immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) and non‑immune cells (endothelial cells, hepatocytes).  
- Also found intracellularly in endosomal compartments after internalization.  
- Constitutive expression in most tissues; up‑regulated by inflammatory stimuli.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the Toll‑like receptor (TLR) family (classical TLRs).  
- Extracellular leucine‑rich repeat (LRR) domain for ligand binding; single transmembrane helix; cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin‑1 receptor (TIR) domain for downstream signaling.  
- Oligomerizes as a homodimer upon ligand engagement.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Recognizes LPS and a broad range of pathogen‑associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger‑associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).  
- Triggers MyD88‑ and TRIF‑dependent signaling cascades, leading to NF‑κB and IRF3 activation, cytokine production, and type I interferon synthesis.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing yields soluble `sTLR4` forms lacking transmembrane and TIR domains; act as decoy receptors.  
- Post‑translational modifications: glycosylation in the LRR domain, phosphorylation of TIR residues modulating signaling.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesis via ribosomal translation of `TLR4` mRNA; no classical metabolic pathway.  
- Trafficking to the membrane involves chaperone `MD‑2` and lipid‑binding protein `CD14`.  
- Degradation primarily through lysosomal pathways after endocytosis.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Primary ligand: lipid A portion of LPS bound by `MD‑2` co‑receptor.  
- Co‑receptors: `CD14`, `CD44`, and `CD36` enhance ligand presentation.  
- Signaling: MyD88‑dependent pathway → IRAK4/IRAK1 → TRAF6 → NF‑κB; TRIF‑dependent pathway → TRAF3 → TBK1/IKKε → IRF3.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In macrophages: drives pro‑inflammatory cytokine release (TNF‑α, IL‑6).  
- In endothelial cells: up‑regulates adhesion molecules (ICAM‑1, VCAM‑1).  
- In adipose tissue: contributes to low‑grade inflammation and insulin resistance.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Modulated by microbial lipids, endogenous danger signals (heat‑shock proteins, hyaluronan fragments).  
- Cross‑talk with cytokine receptors (IL‑1R, TNFR) amplifies inflammatory responses.  
- Regulated by microRNAs (e.g., miR‑146a) that target MyD88.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in `TLR4` (e.g., rs4986790 (Ala>Thr), rs4986791 (Thr>Pro)) alter LPS responsiveness and are linked to susceptibility to sepsis, tuberculosis, and metabolic disease.  
- Copy‑number variations and rare loss‑of‑function mutations observed in immunodeficiency cases.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Saturated fatty acids can activate `TLR4` signaling in adipocytes and macrophages.  
- Polyphenols (curcumin, resveratrol) inhibit `TLR4` activation, offering anti‑inflammatory benefits.  
- Exposure to environmental endotoxins (industrial dust, bioterror agents) elevates systemic `TLR4` activation.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Sepsis**: hyperactivation leads to cytokine storm and organ failure.  
- **Atherosclerosis**: `TLR4` on vascular cells promotes plaque instability.  
- **Metabolic syndrome**: chronic `TLR4` signaling contributes to insulin resistance and NAFLD.  
- **Autoimmune diseases**: dysregulated `TLR4` can drive chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- Small‑molecule inhibitors (e.g., eritoran, TAK‑242) block the TIR domain to dampen `TLR4` signaling.  
- Monoclonal antibodies targeting `MD‑2` or soluble `sTLR4` used to sequester LPS.  
- Clinical trials ongoing for `TLR4` antagonists in sepsis, metabolic disease, and cancer immunotherapy.
