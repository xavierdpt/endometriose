**HPA axis stimulation** is the coordinated activation of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal endocrine pathway in response to stress or circadian cues. The cascade releases `CRH` from the hypothalamus, drives secretion of `ACTH` from the pituitary, and ultimately stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids such as `cortisol`. This pathway modulates metabolism, immune function, and the stress response.

### 2. Location & Context
- Central: `paraventricular nucleus` of the hypothalamus produces `CRH`.  
- Pituitary: `anterior lobe` releases `ACTH`.  
- Adrenal: `zona fasciculata` of the cortex secretes `cortisol`; `zona glomerulosa` produces `aldosterone`.  
- Systemic: hormones act on tissues via blood circulation; feedback is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Endocrine signaling cascade.  
- Consists of neuropeptide (`CRH`), peptide hormone (`ACTH`), and steroid hormone (`cortisol`).  
- Key receptor families: G‑protein–coupled receptors (`CRHR1/CRHR2`, `MC2R`), nuclear receptors (`NR3C1`).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Mobilizes energy substrates (gluconeogenesis, lipolysis).  
- Suppresses pro‑inflammatory cytokines.  
- Regulates circadian rhythms and anticipatory stress responses.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- `ACTH` analogs (e.g., `tetracosactide`).  
- Cortisol metabolites (`cortisone`, `11‑deoxycortisol`).  
- Post‑translational modifications: glycosylation of `ACTH`, phosphorylation of `CRHRs`.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- `CRH` degraded by neutral endopeptidase.  
- `ACTH` catabolized by peptidases in plasma.  
- `Cortisol` metabolized in liver to cortisone via 11β‑HSD1/2 enzymes.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- `CRHR1/CRHR2` in the pituitary: Gq‑protein activation → PLC → IP₃/Ca²⁺ → `ACTH` secretion.  
- `MC2R` on adrenal cells: Gs‑protein activation → adenylyl cyclase → cAMP → steroidogenesis.  
- `NR3C1` in target tissues: glucocorticoid‑bound receptor translocates to nucleus → transcriptional regulation of target genes.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Adrenal cortex: cortisol production; zona glomerulosa: aldosterone secretion.  
- Immune cells: inhibit NF‑κB signaling.  
- Brain: modulate anxiety circuitry via glucocorticoid receptors.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Negative feedback: cortisol binds `NR3C1` in hypothalamus and pituitary to suppress `CRH`/`ACTH`.  
- Cross‑talk with `CRF`‑binding protein, `α₂‑adrenergic` signaling, and the sympathetic nervous system.  
- Modulation by cytokines (`IL‑6`, `TNF‑α`) that can amplify or dampen the axis.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `CRHR1` rs1106043 associated with altered stress reactivity.  
- `MC2R` variants linked to familial glucocorticoid deficiency.  
- `NR3C1` Bcl‑1 polymorphism influences glucocorticoid sensitivity.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Caffeine and nicotine acutely elevate `ACTH` and cortisol.  
- Chronic alcohol consumption dysregulates axis activity.  
- High‑salt diet modulates aldosterone via the axis.  
- Chronic psychosocial stress chronically activates the pathway.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Cushing’s syndrome**: hypersecretion of cortisol due to pituitary or adrenal lesions.  
- **Addison’s disease**: adrenal insufficiency leading to low cortisol and ACTH.  
- **Depression and anxiety**: dysregulated HPA axis activity, often hyper‑ or hypo‑reactive.  
- **Metabolic syndrome**: chronic cortisol exposure contributes to insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

#### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance
- **CRH antagonists** (e.g., `antisauvagine‑30`) investigated for major depression.  
- **ACTH analogs** used for adrenal insufficiency testing.  
- **Glucocorticoid receptor modulators** (e.g., selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists/antagonists) for anti‑inflammatory therapy.
