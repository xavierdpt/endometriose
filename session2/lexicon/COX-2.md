**COX‑2**

**Introductory Summary**  
`COX‑2` (cyclo‑oxygenase‑2, encoded by the gene `PTGS2`) is an inducible enzyme that converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H₂, the precursor of many inflammatory prostaglandins. It is rapidly expressed in response to cytokines and growth factors and plays a key role in initiating and amplifying inflammatory and pain pathways. Its selective inhibition forms the basis of non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and provides therapeutic benefit in a variety of inflammatory diseases.

### 1. Location & Context
- Expressed primarily in the cytosol and associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.  
- Found in many cell types (macrophages, endothelial cells, epithelial cells), with high inducible expression in inflamed tissues.  
- Constitutive expression is low in most normal tissues but increases markedly during injury or infection.

### 2. Classification & Structure
- Member of the cyclo‑oxygenase (COX) enzyme family; belongs to the prostaglandin H synthase family.  
- Consists of two catalytic domains: a cyclo‑oxygenase (cyclooxygenase) domain and a peroxidase domain separated by a hinge region.  
- Requires heme and a Cys‑SR-containing oxyanion hole for activity.

### 3. Physiological / Biological Function
- Catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin `H₂`, feeding downstream synthesis of PGE₂, PGI₂, PGD₂, and TXA₂.  
- Promotes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocyte recruitment, and nociception.  
- Contributes to pain sensitization, fever, and the acute phase inflammatory response.

### 4. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternate splice variants (e.g., `COX‑2EX3` lacking exon 3) are observed in certain tumor types.  
- Post‑translational modifications include phosphorylation at serine residues (Ser353, Ser530) that regulate stability and enzymatic activity.

### 5. Synthesis, Regulation, and Turnover
- Synthesized by translation of the `PTGS2` mRNA in the rough ER; the nascent polypeptide contains an N‑terminal signal anchor for ER insertion.  
- Expression is transcriptionally induced by NF‑κB, AP‑1, and STAT3 downstream of TNF‑α, IL‑1β, and growth factors.  
- Protein stability is increased by phosphorylation and decreased by ubiquitin‑proteasome mediated degradation; pharmacologic NSAIDs can accelerate turnover by inhibiting catalytic activity.  

### 6. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Its enzymatic product, prostaglandin `E₂`, signals through EP1‑EP4 G‑protein coupled receptors, mediating diverse cellular responses.  
- COX‑2 expression is regulated by upstream cytokines and stress pathways, integrating inflammatory and metabolic signals.

### 7. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In the gut lining, COX‑2‑derived prostaglandins protect mucosal integrity and regulate fluid secretion.  
- In the central nervous system, COX‑2 is up‑regulated in astrocytes and microglia during neuroinflammation.  
- In the reproductive tract, COX‑2 activity supports prostaglandin‑mediated uterine contractions.

### 8. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Interacts with `cimentably` and `PPARγ` cofactors to modulate expression.  
- Acts synergistically with COX‑1 to maintain physiological prostaglandin levels; selective COX‑2 inhibition can result in COX‑1–mediated side effects.  
- Modulated by lipid mediators such as lipoxin A₄, which down‑regulates COX‑2 transcription.

### 9. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Single‑nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region (e.g., `−765C>T`, `−524A>G`) influence inducibility and are linked to cardiovascular risk profiles.  
- Coding variants (e.g., `Pro48Leu`, `Thr431Ile`) have been associated with altered enzymatic activity and drug response in cancer patients.

### 10. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Omega‑3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA) competitively inhibit COX‑2 substrates and reduce prostaglandin production.  
- Smoking and exposure to inflammatory toxins stimulate COX‑2 expression via oxidative stress pathways.  
- Regular exercise can transiently up‑regulate COX‑2 in muscle tissue during regeneration.

### 11. Pathophysiological Associations
- Chronic overexpression contributes to atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemic injury, chronic pain conditions, and various cancers (breast, colon, prostate).  
- Elevated COX‑2 levels serve as a biomarker for tumorigenicity, poor prognosis, and treatment resistance.  
- COX‑2 overexpression is central to the development of radiation‑induced tissue injury and is implicated in fibrosis.

### 12. Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting
- Selective COX‑2 inhibitors (coxibs) reduce pain and inflammation while sparing COX‑1–mediated gastric protection.  
- However, cardiovascular risk associated with prolonged COX‑2 inhibition has limited their clinical use.  
- Ongoing research investigates COX‑2 inhibitors with improved selectivity, anti‑tumor agents, and strategies to combine COX‑2 suppression with immunotherapy.
