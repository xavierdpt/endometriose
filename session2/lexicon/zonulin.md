**Zonulin** is a 50‑kDa plasma protein that regulates intestinal barrier integrity by transiently loosening tight junctions between enterocytes. It is released by intestinal epithelial cells in response to luminal cues such as gluten and microbial signals, and its circulating levels correlate with intestinal permeability and autoimmune disease risk.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- Primarily secreted into the gut lumen and systemic circulation from intestinal enterocytes.  
- Present in human plasma at nanomolar concentrations; expression is high in the small intestine and lower in other tissues.  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Encoded by the `F12` locus (pre‑haptoglobin‑2, `HPT2`), a member of the haptoglobin family.  
- Consists of a signal peptide followed by a large extracellular domain (~50 kDa) rich in glycosylation sites.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Modulates tight‑junction integrity by disrupting occludin‑claudin interactions, leading to increased paracellular permeability.  
- Facilitates translocation of antigens and luminal macromolecules, thereby influencing immune tolerance.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Mature zonulin is produced from the pre‑haptoglobin‑2 precursor after proteolytic cleavage.  
- Post‑translational modifications include N‑glycosylation and potential phosphorylation of the extracellular domain.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Synthesized in enterocytes; secretion is stimulated by intestinal stimuli (gluten, bacterial LPS).  
- Degraded by proteases in the circulation and the gut lumen; clearance primarily via the liver and kidneys.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Binds to a yet‑unidentified receptor on enterocytes, triggering a downstream MAPK/ERK cascade that leads to tight‑junction disassembly.  
- Increases intracellular calcium, activating downstream phospholipase A₂ and arachidonic acid production.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- Predominantly acts on small‑intestine enterocytes; limited effects reported in colon, liver, and pancreas.  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Interacts with components of the gut microbiome (e.g., bacterial LPS) and dietary peptides (gluten).  
- May modulate the activity of tight‑junction proteins such as `occludin` and `claudin‑1`.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNPs in the `F12` locus (e.g., rsXXXX) influence baseline plasma zonulin levels and susceptibility to celiac disease.  
- Copy‑number variations of the `HPT2` gene correlate with differential zonulin expression.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Gluten ingestion in celiac patients triggers zonulin release; gluten‑free diet reduces levels.  
- Probiotics and prebiotics can modulate zonulin secretion by altering gut microbial composition.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Elevated plasma zonulin is a biomarker of increased intestinal permeability in celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, Crohn’s disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.  
- Chronic high zonulin may contribute to systemic inflammation and autoimmunity.  

### Clinical Biomarker  
- **Zonulin ELISA** is routinely used to assess intestinal barrier integrity in research and clinical diagnostics.  

### Therapeutic Relevance  
- Zonulin antagonists (e.g., larazotide acetate) are under investigation for celiac disease and other permeability‑associated disorders.
