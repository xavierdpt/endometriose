**IL‑1β** (Interleukin‑1 beta) is a pro‑inflammatory cytokine produced mainly by activated macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. It acts as a key mediator of innate immunity, orchestrating fever, leukocyte recruitment, and the acute‑phase response. Elevated IL‑1β levels contribute to a wide spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

### 2. Location & Context
- Synthesized as a 31‑kDa intracellular precursor (`pro‑IL‑1β`) in the cytoplasm.  
- Secreted into the extracellular milieu after cleavage by caspase‑1 within the inflammasome.  
- Circulates at low picomolar concentrations under normal conditions, rising to nanomolar levels during inflammation.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Cytokine belonging to the IL‑1 family; gene locus on chromosome 2q14.  
- Mature IL‑1β (~17 kDa) lacks a signal peptide; adopts a β‑barrel fold typical of IL‑1 family members.  
- No glycosylation sites; activity depends on proteolytic processing.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Induces expression of adhesion molecules (`ICAM‑1`, `VCAM‑1`) on endothelial cells.  
- Stimulates production of other cytokines (`IL‑6`, `TNF‑α`) and chemokines.  
- Drives fever by acting on the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- `Pro‑IL‑1β` (inactive precursor) and mature IL‑1β.  
- No known splice variants.  
- Post‑translationally processed by caspase‑1; no other major modifications.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized via NF‑κB‑dependent transcription upon LPS or cytokine stimulation.  
- Activation requires inflammasome assembly (NLRP3, AIM2) → caspase‑1 → proteolytic cleavage.  
- Degraded by extracellular proteases and soluble IL‑1 receptor antagonist (IL‑1Ra).

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds `IL1R1` (IL‑1 receptor type 1) with high affinity; signal complex includes `IL1RAcP`.  
- Activates MyD88‑dependent pathway → IRAK, TRAF6, TAK1 → NF‑κB and MAPK (ERK, JNK, p38).  
- Induces transcription of inflammatory mediators.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In joints: upregulates cartilage‑degrading enzymes (`MMP‑1`, `MMP‑13`).  
- In the CNS: contributes to neuroinflammation, blood‑brain barrier disruption.  
- In the skin: promotes keratinocyte proliferation and psoriasis lesions.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Co‑regulates with `IL‑18`, `TNF‑α`; synergistic with TLR ligands.  
- Neutralized by `IL‑1Ra` and soluble `IL1R2`.  
- Modulated by lipid mediators (e.g., prostaglandins) that amplify its production.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNP `-511C>T` in the promoter reduces IL‑1β transcription; associated with lower risk of atherosclerosis.  
- `+3954C>T` (exon 5) linked to increased IL‑1β secretion in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.  
- Copy‑number variations rare; most pathogenic variants lead to autoinflammatory syndromes (CAPS).

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Short‑chain fatty acids (butyrate) suppress IL‑1β production via HDAC inhibition.  
- Dietary omega‑3 fatty acids reduce IL‑1β–mediated inflammation.  
- Smoking, endotoxin exposure, and chronic viral infections elevate IL‑1β levels.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Core biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  
- Elevated in sepsis; correlates with disease severity and mortality.  
- Central in autoinflammatory syndromes such as Cryopyrin‑Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS).

#### Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests
- Serum or synovial fluid IL‑1β measured by ELISA; threshold >5 pg/mL indicates active inflammation.  
- Gene expression profiling (qPCR) of `IL1B` in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

#### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting
- `Anakinra` (recombinant IL‑1Ra) competes for `IL1R1`, blocking IL‑1β signaling.  
- `Canakinumab` (human monoclonal antibody) neutralizes IL‑1β; approved for RA, CAPS, and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic events.  
- Small‑molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome reduce IL‑1β maturation.
