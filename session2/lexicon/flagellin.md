**Flagellin**

Flagellin is the principal structural protein of bacterial flagella, forming the filament that propels motility. It is recognized by the innate immune system as a pathogen‑associated molecular pattern, triggering inflammatory responses through toll‑like receptor signaling.

### 1. Introductory Summary  
Flagellin is the monomeric subunit that polymerizes to form the filament of bacterial flagella. It functions as a motility scaffold and as an immunostimulatory ligand for host innate immunity.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Cytoplasmic‑origin protein that is exported via the flagellar type III secretion system.  
- Assembles on the exterior of the cell, forming a helical filament extending tens of micrometers.  
- Abundance correlates with growth phase; in *E. coli* and *Salmonella* ~10⁴–10⁵ molecules per cell during active swimming.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Belongs to the bacterial flagellin family; conserved N‑ and C‑terminal domains (D0/D1) with a highly variable central domain (D2/D3).  
- Typically ~495 aa; each monomer has a central hydrophilic groove facilitating polymerization.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Provides the structural framework for flagellar rotation, enabling chemotaxis and surface navigation.  
- The conserved N‑terminal region forms the filament core; the variable central region mediates species‑specific antigenicity.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- **Variants**: Salmonella Typhimurium `fliC`, *Bacillus* flagellin `flaB`; sequence divergences alter host immune recognition.  
- **Post‑translational modifications**: Rare phosphorylation in *Pseudomonas*; glycosylation in *Campylobacter* flagellin modifies host interaction.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Synthesized by ribosomes; exported via the flagellar T3SS; assembled into the filament extracellularly.  
- Degradation occurs via proteases (e.g., HtrA) once filament integrity is compromised.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Recognized by host TLR5 and NLRC4 inflammasome components.  
- Binding to TLR5 initiates MyD88‑dependent NF‑κB activation, leading to cytokine production.  
- Some bacteria express `FlgM` to inhibit flagellin export, modulating immune visibility.

### 8. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Flagellin interacts with bacterial chaperones (e.g., FliS) to prevent premature folding.  
- Can form complexes with LPS or outer membrane proteins, influencing flagellar assembly.

### 9. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Over‑expression or surface exposure of flagellin triggers systemic inflammation in septicemia.  
- Flagellin‑specific antibodies serve as biomarkers for certain enteric infections.  
- Targeting flagellin–TLR5 interaction is explored for adjuvant development in vaccines.
