**Autoreactive T cells**

Autoreactive T cells are T lymphocytes that recognize self‑antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. They escape central and peripheral tolerance checkpoints and can initiate or propagate autoimmune responses. Their presence is a hallmark of many organ‑specific and systemic autoimmune diseases.

### 2. Location & Context
- Circulate in peripheral blood and reside in secondary lymphoid organs.  
- Infiltrate target tissues (e.g., pancreas, joints, nervous system) during autoimmune inflammation.  
- Their frequency is low in healthy individuals (< 1 % of CD4⁺ or CD8⁺ T cells).

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Subset of mature `T` cells expressing a specific T cell receptor (`TCR`) that binds a self‑peptide–MHC complex.  
- Classified by helper/effector phenotype: `CD4⁺` Th1/Th17 or `CD8⁺` cytotoxic subsets.  
- No unique structural domains beyond the canonical `TCRαβ` or `TCRγδ` chains.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Normally mediate immune surveillance and tolerance.  
- When autoreactive, they produce pro‑inflammatory cytokines (`IFN‑γ`, `IL‑17`) and cytotoxic mediators (`perforin`, `granzyme B`).  
- Drive tissue damage and chronic inflammation in autoimmunity.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing of `CD45` or `CD28` can modulate co‑stimulatory thresholds.  
- Post‑translational modifications of `TCRζ` (e.g., phosphorylation) influence signaling strength.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Not applicable (cell type, not a metabolite).

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Recognize self‑peptide–`MHC` via `TCR`.  
- Co‑receptors: `CD4` for MHC class II, `CD8` for MHC class I.  
- Signal through the `CD3` complex → Lck → ZAP‑70 → downstream MAPK, NF‑κB, and NFAT pathways.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In type 1 diabetes, `CD8⁺` autoreactive T cells infiltrate pancreatic islets and lyse β‑cells.  
- In multiple sclerosis, `CD4⁺` Th17 cells target myelin basic protein in CNS.  
- In rheumatoid arthritis, autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells produce IL‑17 and TNF‑α in synovial tissue.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Secrete cytokines that recruit and activate macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells.  
- Interact with regulatory `Treg` cells; loss of suppression leads to expansion.  
- Respond to danger‑associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) via innate immune receptors (e.g., TLRs).

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- HLA‑DRB1*04, HLA‑DQ2/8 alleles increase autoreactive TCR repertoire.  
- Polymorphisms in `CTLA4`, `PTPN22`, and `IL2RA` alter T‑cell activation thresholds.  
- Mutations in `AIRE` (autoimmune regulator) impair negative selection, allowing autoreactive clones.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Vitamin D deficiency correlates with increased autoreactive T‑cell frequency.  
- Certain bacterial metabolites (e.g., butyrate) can modulate `Treg` function and reduce autoreactivity.  
- Viral infections (e.g., EBV, CMV) can trigger by‑stander activation or molecular mimicry.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Central to the etiology of type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoimmune thyroid disease.  
- Biomarkers: presence of autoreactive T‑cell clones detected by MHC tetramer staining or ELISPOT for specific autoantigens.  
- Clinical features: tissue‑specific inflammation, organ dysfunction, and autoantibody production.

### Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests
- MHC class I/II tetramer assays to identify antigen‑specific T cells.  
- Functional assays: cytokine secretion (ELISPOT, intracellular staining) after stimulation with self‑antigen peptides.  
- Flow cytometric phenotyping of activation markers (`CD69`, `CD154`) on T cells.

### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting
- Checkpoint inhibitors (anti‑`PD‑1`, anti‑`CTLA‑4`) risk exacerbating autoreactive T cells.  
- Therapies targeting `CD4`/`CD8` co‑receptors, or downstream signaling (e.g., JAK inhibitors, BTK inhibitors) aim to dampen autoreactive responses.  
- Adoptive Treg expansion or tolerogenic dendritic cell therapies seek to restore immune tolerance.
