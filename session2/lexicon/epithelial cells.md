**Title:** Epithelial Cells  

Epithelial cells line the surfaces and cavities of organs throughout the body, forming protective barriers and specialized interfaces. They regulate transport, secretion, and defense against pathogens, while also serving as structural components in tissues such as skin, mucosa, and glandular epithelia. Their diverse morphologies and functions are essential for homeostasis and organ integrity.

### 2. Location & Context
- Found on internal and external surfaces: skin (cutaneous epithelium), gastrointestinal tract (intestinal epithelium), respiratory tract (ciliated epithelium), urogenital tract, and glandular secretory surfaces.  
- Abundant in all mammals; represent 30–40 % of body cell mass.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Classified by shape and polarity: squamous, cuboidal, columnar, and transitional (urothelium).  
- Exhibit apical‑basal polarity, tight junctions (claudin, occludin), desmosomes, and adherens junctions (cadherins).  
- Specialized organelles: microvilli, cilia, and secretory vesicles.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Form selective barriers controlling paracellular transport.  
- Secrete mucus, antimicrobial peptides, and hormones.  
- Provide sensory functions (taste buds, olfactory epithelium).  
- Participate in wound healing via rapid proliferation.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Generate mucus glycoproteins (mucin families `MUC1`–`MUC5B`).  
- Express keratin intermediate filaments (`KRT` family).  
- Post‑translationally modified keratins (phosphorylation, glycosylation).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- High turnover of membrane lipids: phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin.  
- Metabolic enzymes: cytochrome P450 in liver epithelium, alkaline phosphatase in intestinal epithelium.  
- Engaged in detoxification of xenobiotics via conjugation reactions.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Express pattern‑recognition receptors (`TLR4`, `NOD2`) for innate immunity.  
- Respond to growth factors: epidermal growth factor receptor (`EGFR`), transforming growth factor‑β (`TGF‑β`).  
- Signaling cascades include MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β‑catenin pathways.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Squamous epithelium: barrier, water‑retention (skin).  
- Ciliated epithelium: mucociliary clearance (respiratory tract).  
- Goblet cells: mucin secretion (intestinal, respiratory).  
- Paneth cells: antimicrobial peptides in small intestine.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Bind extracellular matrix proteins (collagen, laminin) via integrins.  
- Secrete cytokines (`IL-6`, `IL-8`) modulating immune responses.  
- Interact with gut microbiota through MHC class II presentation and pattern‑recognition.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Polymorphisms in `MUC1` and `MUC5AC` associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and colorectal cancer risk.  
- Variants in `KRT1`/`KRT10` linked to ichthyosis vulgaris.  
- Copy‑number variations of `EGFR` influence epithelial cell proliferation.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Vitamin A (retinoic acid) essential for epithelial differentiation.  
- UV exposure induces keratinocyte proliferation and DNA damage.  
- Smoking impairs ciliary function and increases epithelial oxidative stress.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Hyperproliferation → squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma.  
- Dysregulation of tight junctions leads to inflammatory bowel disease.  
- Loss of cilia function causes primary ciliary dyskinesia.  
- Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to fibrosis and metastasis.
