**Farnesoid‑X‑receptor (FXR)**  
The farnesoid‑X‑receptor (FXR) is a nuclear hormone receptor that functions as a bile acid sensor. It regulates bile acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and glucose control, thereby playing a central role in liver, intestine, and metabolic disease biology.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Cytosol and nucleus of hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, enterocytes, and renal tubular cells.  
- High hepatic expression; moderate in intestinal crypt cells and kidney cortex.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- Member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (NR1H4).  
- Contains a ligand‑binding domain with a typical steroid‑binding pocket and a DNA‑binding domain (two Cys‑2‑His‑2 zinc fingers).

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Senses primary bile acids (e.g., chenodeoxycholic acid) and represses bile acid synthesis via induction of *CYP7A1* and *CYP8B1* transcription.  
- Enhances fecal bile acid excretion and regulates triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Activated by synthetic agonists (e.g., obeticholic acid) and endogenous ligands (bile acids, lithocholic acid).  
- Post‑translational modifications include phosphorylation (Ser^196) and SUMOylation (K^399).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- Ligand activation involves deconjugation of taurine/ glycine‑conjugated bile acids by gut microbiota before hepatic uptake.  
- FXR‑mediated transcription of *BSEP* (bile salt export pump) facilitates bile acid excretion.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- Forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR).  
- Binds to FXR response elements (FXREs) in promoter regions of target genes.  
- Genomic signaling predominates; non‑genomic pathways involve rapid modulation of ion channels in cholangiocytes.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Liver:** Down‑regulates bile acid synthesis, stimulates conjugated bile acid transport.  
- **Intestine:** Induces *IBABP* (ileal bile acid binding protein), enhancing bile acid reabsorption.  
- **Kidney:** Promotes bicarbonate reabsorption via *SLC26A6* regulation.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Crosstalk with liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) pathways.  
- Modulates insulin signaling through regulation of *SREBP‑1c* and *GLUT2* expression.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- SNP rs10774625 in *NR1H4* associated with altered FXR activity and increased risk of non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease.  
- Loss‑of‑function variants linked to cholestatic liver disorders.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- High‑fat, high‑cholesterol diets elevate hepatic bile acid load, activating FXR.  
- Phytochemicals (e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid) act as FXR agonists and influence gut microbiota composition.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- Dysregulated FXR signaling contributes to cholestasis, primary biliary cholangitis, and non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis.  
- FXR agonists are approved for treating primary biliary cholangitis and under investigation for fibrosis and metabolic syndrome.

### 13. Therapeutic Relevance / Drug Targeting  
- **Obeticholic acid (OCA):** potent FXR agonist approved for primary biliary cholangitis; also in trials for NASH and liver fibrosis.  
- Emerging selective FXR modulators aim to minimize side effects such as pruritus and lipid profile alterations.
