**Lymphopenia** is a hematologic condition characterized by a reduced absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. In adults, an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of less than 1.0 × 10⁹ cells L⁻¹ is generally considered diagnostic. The disorder can arise from infections, immunodeficiency syndromes, bone‑marrow suppression, or therapeutic interventions such as chemotherapy or radiation.

## 2. Location & Context
- **Site**: Peripheral blood; reflected in lymphocyte subsets (T cells, B cells, NK cells).  
- **Normal range**: 1.0–3.0 × 10⁹ cells L⁻¹; thresholds may vary by age, sex, and laboratory standards.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Infections**: HIV, viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe sepsis, and COVID‑19.  
- **Immunodeficiencies**: Primary (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiency) and secondary (e.g., malnutrition, chronic stress).  
- **Bone‑marrow disorders**: Aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, leukemia.  
- **Therapeutic causes**: Chemotherapy (alkylators, antimetabolites), targeted agents (BTK inhibitors), radiotherapy, immunosuppressants.  
- **Autoimmune disease**: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (especially during flare).  
- **Metabolic and endocrine**: Hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism.

## Optional Sections

### Clinical Biomarkers / Diagnostic Tests
- **Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)** via complete blood count.  
- **Flow cytometry**: Lymphocyte subset profiling (CD3⁺, CD4⁺, CD8⁺, CD19⁺, CD56⁺).  
- **T‑cell receptor excision circles (TRECs)**: Assessment of thymic output.  
- **Serologic markers**: Viral loads (HIV, EBV, CMV) to determine infectious etiologies.

### Therapeutic Relevance / Management
- **Address underlying cause**: Antiretroviral therapy for HIV, antibiotics for bacterial infections, disease‑modifying drugs for autoimmune disease.  
- **Supportive care**: Prophylactic antimicrobials, IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia.  
- **Growth factors**: Granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor (GM‑CSF) can indirectly improve lymphocyte recovery.  
- **Cell therapy**: Adoptive transfer of virus‑specific T cells or NK cells in refractory viral infections.  
- **Monitoring**: Serial ALC and subset analysis to guide therapy adjustments.
