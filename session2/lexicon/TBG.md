**Thyroxine‑binding globulin (TBG)** is a serum‑fibrinogen‑like glycoprotein that transports the majority of circulating thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T₄) and, to a lesser extent, triiodothyronine (T₃). It serves as a key regulator of free hormone availability, thereby influencing metabolic rate and developmental processes. Mutations or altered expression of `TBG` can markedly affect thyroid hormone homeostasis and are implicated in various clinical thyroid disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Predominantly synthesized by hepatocytes and secreted into the bloodstream.  
- Circulates as a 50 kDa monomer with a glycosylated, fibronectin‑type III domain architecture.  
- Plasma concentration ≈ 0.2 µM (≈ 10 % of total thyroid hormone binding capacity).

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the serum‑fibrinogen‑like protein (SFP) family.  
- Contains two fibronectin‑type III domains; the C‑terminal domain contains the primary hormone‑binding pocket.  
- Post‑translational N‑glycosylation at Asn‑125 and Asn‑198 enhances stability and ligand affinity.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Binds ~70 % of circulating T₄ and ~20 % of T₃, maintaining a reservoir of hormone.  
- Regulates free hormone concentration, thereby modulating tissue uptake via deiodinases.  
- Alters the half‑life of thyroid hormones, extending systemic circulation.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing produces a short “TBG‑Δ” isoform lacking the C‑terminal domain (low binding).  
- Glycoforms with high mannose or complex N‑glycans show minor differences in affinity.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, assembled as a disulfide‑linked monomer, and secreted by exocytosis.  
- Catabolized by hepatic proteases (cathepsin D) and hepatic clearance pathways; no significant deiodination occurs.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- No direct cell‑surface receptors; its primary role is ligand sequestration.  
- Modulates the activation of nuclear thyroid hormone receptors indirectly by controlling free hormone availability.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- High levels in plasma influence brain, skeletal muscle, and cardiac tissue through regulation of free T₃.  
- Hepatic synthesis allows local modulation of bile acid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Interacts with transthyretin, albumin, and the sodium‑iodide symporter via competitive binding to T₄/T₃.  
- In the presence of high albumin concentrations (e.g., pregnancy), the relative proportion of hormone bound to TBG diminishes.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `TBG` gene located on chromosome 3q26.2; common variants include p.Ala52Thr and p.Ser115Ala with reduced binding affinity.  
- Pathogenic null mutations cause TBG deficiency, leading to isolated hypothyroxinemia.  
- Over‑expression variants (e.g., p.Gly132Arg) cause TBG excess and apparent hyperthyroxinemia.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Zinc deficiency reduces TBG glycosylation and expression.  
- Estrogens (oral contraceptives, pregnancy) upregulate TBG transcription, increasing total hormone levels.  
- Alcohol consumption and hepatic disease downregulate TBG synthesis.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **TBG deficiency**: Elevated free T₄/T₃; normal metabolic state but may be misdiagnosed as subclinical hypothyroidism.  
- **TBG excess**: Apparent hyperthyroxinemia; total T₄ is elevated while free hormone remains normal.  
- **Pregnancy**: Elevated TBG contributes to increased total T₄; free hormone must be interpreted with trimester‑specific reference ranges.  
- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Decreased TBG correlates with reduced total hormone levels; may mask underlying hypothyroidism.

### Optional: Clinical Biomarkers & Diagnostic Tests
- **Serum TBG measurement** (immunoassay or radioimmunoassay) differentiates binding globulin disorders from true thyroid disease.  
- **Total vs. free T₄/T₃ ratio** assists in identifying altered TBG concentrations.

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance
- TBG levels are not directly targeted therapeutically; however, accurate interpretation of thyroid function tests in patients with altered TBG is essential for appropriate management.
