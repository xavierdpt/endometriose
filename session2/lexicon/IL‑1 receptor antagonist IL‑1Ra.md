**IL‑1 receptor antagonist (IL‑1Ra)**  
IL‑1Ra is a naturally occurring soluble cytokine that blocks the pro‑inflammatory actions of interleukin‑1α and interleukin‑1β. By competitively binding the IL‑1 type I receptor (IL‑1R1) without recruiting the co‑receptor IL‑1RAcP, it prevents downstream activation of NF‑κB and MAPK pathways, thereby limiting inflammation. It is a key endogenous regulator of innate immune responses and is therapeutically exploited in several autoinflammatory diseases.

### 2. Location & Context
- Secreted into the extracellular space; detectable in plasma (20–100 ng mL⁻¹) and synovial fluid.  
- Expressed by macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, epithelial and endothelial cells.  
- Levels rise rapidly during acute inflammation and sepsis.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the interleukin‑1 family; homologous to IL‑1α/β but lacks the C‑terminal activation helix.  
- ~18 kDa glycoprotein (161 aa).  
- Contains a signal peptide, an N‑terminal α‑helical domain, and a C‑terminal β‑strand that is crucial for receptor binding.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Antagonizes IL‑1α/β by occupying IL‑1R1 and blocking IL‑1RAcP recruitment.  
- Suppresses NF‑κB and MAPK signaling, reducing expression of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.  
- Maintains immune homeostasis and prevents excessive tissue damage.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Two isoforms: soluble IL‑1Ra1 (extracellular) and intracellular IL‑1Ra2 (cytosolic).  
- Post‑translational modifications: N‑glycosylation at Asn‑62; possible O‑glycosylation sites.  
- Alternative splicing of the 3′ UTR influences mRNA stability.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized in the ER and secreted via the classical Golgi pathway.  
- Degraded by extracellular proteases (e.g., MMP‑9, ADAMTS‑4) and cleared renally; plasma half‑life ~4–6 h.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds IL‑1R1 with high affinity (KD ≈ 10⁻⁸ M).  
- Does **not** recruit IL‑1RAcP, thereby acting as a competitive inhibitor without initiating signal transduction.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Innate immunity:** limits cytokine storms in macrophages and neutrophils.  
- **Cardiovascular:** protects myocardium from ischemia‑reperfusion injury.  
- **Central nervous system:** reduces microglial activation and neuroinflammation.  
- **Joints:** suppresses cartilage degradation in rheumatoid arthritis and gout.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Binds IL‑1R2 (decoy receptor), modulating its availability.  
- Interacts with soluble IL‑1Ra‑binding protein (IL‑1RBP), influencing clearance.  
- Its expression is up‑regulated by TNF, IFN‑γ, and IL‑10; down‑regulated by smoking and stress hormones.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- **IL1RN promoter SNP rs1143634 (C/T):** T allele associated with lower expression and increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease.  
- **Copy‑number variation:** Deletions or duplications of the IL1RN cluster linked to autoinflammatory syndromes such as CINCA (Cryopyrin‑Associated Periodic Syndromes).  
- Rare loss‑of‑function mutations cause severe, early‑onset autoinflammation.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Omega‑3 fatty acids and vitamin D enhance IL‑1Ra expression.  
- Smoking and chronic stress suppress IL‑1Ra levels.  
- Dietary antioxidants (e.g., polyphenols) may up‑regulate its transcription via NF‑κB inhibition.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Elevated serum IL‑1Ra is a biomarker for disease activity in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis.  
- **CINCA syndrome:** IL‑1Ra deficiency leads to uncontrolled IL‑1 signaling, causing chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular disease.  
- **Therapeutic relevance:** Recombinant IL‑1Ra (Anakinra) and IL‑1 decoy receptor (Rilonacept) are approved for rheumatoid arthritis, SJIA, and CAPS.  

**Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests**  
- Serum IL‑1Ra measured by ELISA correlates with inflammatory burden and therapeutic response.  

**Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting**  
- Anakinra (human recombinant IL‑1Ra) blocks IL‑1 signaling in RA, SJIA, gout, and autoinflammatory disorders.  
- Rilonacept, a soluble IL‑1 receptor decoy, sequesters IL‑1α/β and IL‑1Ra, providing prolonged inhibition.
