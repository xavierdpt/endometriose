**TSH resistance** is a disorder of reduced thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) sensitivity that typically presents with elevated serum `TSH` and normal or low free `T4`.  The condition can be inherited (autosomal dominant TSH‑receptor mutations) or acquired (e.g., excess iodine, antithyroid drugs).  It is a key differential diagnosis of isolated hypothyroxinemia with high `TSH`.  

## 2. Location & Context
- Expressed in thyrocytes (thyroid follicular cells) and in the pituitary `TSH‑producing` cells.  
- Normal TSH concentrations: 0.5–5 µIU/mL; in resistance, `TSH` often >10 µIU/mL.

## 3. Classification & Structure
- **Type**: Somatic (thyroid‑cell) or pituitary (central) resistance.  
- **Molecular**: Mutations in the `TSHR` gene (GPCR family A).  
- **Structure**: 7‑transmembrane receptor with extracellular leucine‑rich domain for TSH binding.

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Normal TSH binding → activation of Gs protein → ↑`cAMP` → synthesis/secretion of `T4` and `T3`.  
- In resistance, this signaling cascade is blunted, leading to impaired hormone production.

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Splice variants of `TSHR` (e.g., short N‑terminal isoform) have altered ligand affinity.  
- Post‑translational modifications: glycosylation at Asn‑45 and Asn‑56 modulates surface expression.

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Not a metabolic pathway; `TSH` is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the pituitary.  
- `TSHR` signaling depends on adenylate cyclase activity and PKA downstream.

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- `TSH` binds the extracellular domain of `TSHR`; key residues include Arg^179, Lys^183.  
- Mutations in residues such as Glu^596, Leu^604, Ser^610 disrupt ligand binding or G‑protein coupling.

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Thyroid follicular cells: impaired iodide organification and hormone synthesis.  
- Pituitary thyrotrophs: potential feedback resistance leading to hyperplasia in some cases.

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- `TRH` stimulation of the pituitary remains intact.  
- High serum `T3` and `T4` can exert negative feedback, sometimes masking the resistance.

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Autosomal dominant pathogenic variants: `p.E596K`, `p.L604I`, `p.S610P`.  
- Common polymorphisms: `c.1336C>T (p.Ala446Val)` may increase `TSH` levels modestly.  
- Gene dosage: heterozygous carriers show milder phenotypes; homozygous may have neonatal hypothyroidism.

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Excessive iodine intake or `PTU`/`methimazole` therapy can mimic resistance.  
- Selenium deficiency may exacerbate thyroid dysfunction but does not directly alter `TSHR`.

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Clinical features: isolated hyperthyrotropinemia, normal or low free `T4`, possible goiter.  
- Complications: impaired growth and neurodevelopment in children, infertility in adults.  

### Optional Sections

#### Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests
- Serum `TSH` >10 µIU/mL with normal/low free `T4`.  
- Thyroid‑scan with low uptake despite elevated `TSH`.  
- Genetic sequencing of `TSHR` confirms pathogenic mutations.

#### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting
- High‑dose levothyroxine to suppress `TSH` and restore euthyroidism.  
- Potential use of `TSH‑agonist` peptides in severe resistance (experimental).  

#### Molecular pathways
- `TSHR` → Gs → `adenylate cyclase` → `cAMP` → PKA → `thyroglobulin` transcription and hormone secretion.  
- Resistance disrupts this cascade at the receptor or Gs level.
