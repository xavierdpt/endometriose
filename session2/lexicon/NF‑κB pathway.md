**NF‑κB Pathway**

The NF‑κB (nuclear factor kappa‑B) signaling pathway is a central regulator of inflammation, immune responses, cell survival, and development. Activation leads to translocation of NF‑κB dimers into the nucleus, where they modulate transcription of genes involved in cytokine production, anti‑apoptotic factors, and cell‑adhesion molecules. Dysregulation is implicated in chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

### 2. Location & Context
- Primarily cytosolic as inactive heterodimers (e.g., `p50/p65`) bound to IκB inhibitors.  
- Upon activation, NF‑κB translocates to the nucleus.  
- Expressed ubiquitously but activity is highest in immune and epithelial cells.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Family: Rel family of transcription factors.  
- Key domains: Rel homology domain (RHD) for DNA binding and dimerization; transactivation domain (TAD) in the RelA subunit.  
- Core components: `p50`, `p65` (RelA), `p52`, `RelB`, `c‑Rel`.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Induces genes encoding cytokines (`TNF`, `IL‑1β`), chemokines, adhesion molecules, and anti‑apoptotic proteins (`BCL‑XL`).  
- Coordinates innate and adaptive immune responses, promotes cell survival, and modulates inflammatory signaling.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Alternative splicing generates `p65α`, `p65β`, and other variants.  
- Post‑translational modifications: phosphorylation (e.g., at Ser536 of `p65`), ubiquitination, acetylation, and sumoylation.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Activation relies on the IKK complex (`IKKα`, `IKKβ`, `NEMO`) that phosphorylates IκB, targeting it for proteasomal degradation.  
- No classical metabolic pathway; regulated by ubiquitin‑proteasome system.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Triggered by diverse receptors: TLRs, cytokine receptors (`TNFR`, `IL‑1R`), antigen‑receptor complexes, and stress sensors.  
- Canonical pathway: receptor → adaptor proteins → IKK activation → IκB phosphorylation → NF‑κB nuclear translocation.  
- Non‑canonical pathway: `p52/RelB` activation via NF‑κB inducing kinase (NIK).

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Immune cells**: Drives pro‑inflammatory cytokine production and lymphocyte activation.  
- **Endothelial cells**: Enhances expression of adhesion molecules, promoting leukocyte recruitment.  
- **Neurons**: Modulates neuroinflammatory responses and cell survival.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cross‑talk with MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT pathways.  
- Modulated by reactive oxygen species and calcium signaling.  
- Interacts with transcriptional co‑activators (e.g., CBP/p300) and repressors (e.g., IκBα).

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in the `NFKBIA` promoter (IκBα) affect inflammatory gene expression.  
- Variants in `IKKβ` and `NEMO` linked to autoinflammatory syndromes.  
- Polymorphisms in NF‑κB target genes (e.g., `TNFA`, `IL6`) influence disease susceptibility.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- **Anti‑inflammatory diets**: Omega‑3 fatty acids and polyphenols (e.g., curcumin) inhibit NF‑κB activation.  
- **Stressors**: Oxidative stress, UV radiation, and microbial components (LPS) stimulate NF‑κB.  
- **Tobacco smoke** and pollutants act as NF‑κB activators.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Chronic inflammatory diseases**: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma.  
- **Autoimmune disorders**: systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis.  
- **Cancer**: promotes tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis.  
- **Metabolic disorders**: obesity‑related inflammation and insulin resistance.

### Optional: Therapeutic Relevance
- **Inhibitors**: IKK inhibitors (e.g., BMS‑345541), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) indirectly reduce NF‑κB activation.  
- **Natural compounds**: Quercetin, resveratrol, and sulforaphane exhibit NF‑κB‑modulatory effects.  
- **Clinical trials**: Several agents targeting NF‑κB are under investigation for inflammatory and oncologic indications.
