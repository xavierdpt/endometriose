**Adrenal cortisol** is a steroid hormone produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. It functions as a key regulator of the stress response, metabolism, and immune function, and its dysregulation underlies several endocrine and metabolic disorders.

### 2. Location & Context
- Synthesized in the **zona fasciculata** of the adrenal cortex and released into the bloodstream.  
- Concentrations oscillate diurnally, peaking in the early morning (≈ 18–20 µg dL⁻¹).  
- Acts systemically but also has autocrine/paracrine roles in peripheral tissues.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Belongs to the **glucocorticoid** class of steroid hormones.  
- Five‑carbon pregnane backbone (C21) with 3 rings (A‑C) and a side‑chain on ring D; functional groups: 11β‑hydroxyl, 3‑oxo, 17α‑hydroxyl.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Metabolic effects**: promotes gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and proteolysis.  
- **Immunomodulatory**: suppresses pro‑inflammatory cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation.  
- **Stress‑related**: facilitates adaptation to physiological stress by altering energy availability and immune responsiveness.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Endogenous analogs: `corticosterone`, `cortisone`, `dehydrocorticosterone`.  
- Metabolites: 20‑hydroxy‑cortisol, 6‑dehydrocorticosterone; glucuronidated conjugates for excretion.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- **Biosynthesis**: cholesterol → pregnenolone → 17‑hydroxypregnenolone → `cortisol` via `CYP11B1` (11β‑hydroxylase).  
- **Inactivation**: `HSD11B1` converts `cortisol` ↔ `cortisone`; conjugation by UDP‑glucuronosyltransferases facilitates renal clearance.  
- **Catabolism**: sequential oxidation to inactive metabolites excreted in urine.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds cytosolic `GR` (NR3C1); upon ligand binding, translocates to the nucleus.  
- **Genomic action**: modulates transcription of glucocorticoid‑responsive genes via hormone‑response elements.  
- **Non‑genomic actions**: rapid modulation of ion channels and signaling cascades through membrane‑associated GR or other surface proteins.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Liver**: stimulates gluconeogenic enzyme expression.  
- **Adipose**: enhances lipolysis via hormone‑sensitive lipase activation.  
- **Muscle**: induces protein catabolism by upregulating ubiquitin‑proteasome pathway.  
- **Brain**: modulates anxiety, cognition, and circadian rhythms.  
- **Immune cells**: downregulates NF‑κB signaling, reducing cytokine secretion.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Cross‑talk with `ACTH`/`CRH` from the pituitary‑hypothalamic axis; co‑regulated with catecholamines.  
- Competes with mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) at high concentrations; modulates insulin sensitivity and leptin signaling.  
- Interacts with cytokines (IL‑6, TNF‑α), growth factors, and stress‑related neuropeptides.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `NR3C1` variants: BclI, N363S, ER22/23EK alter glucocorticoid sensitivity.  
- `HSD11B1` polymorphisms influence conversion rates between cortisol and cortisone.  
- Rare `CYP11B1` mutations cause impaired cortisol synthesis (congenital adrenal hyperplasia).

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Elevated by acute stress, sleep deprivation, and high‑carbohydrate meals.  
- Exogenous glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) suppress endogenous production via negative feedback.  
- Circadian rhythm drives diurnal secretion; shift work and jet lag can disrupt patterns.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Cushing’s syndrome**: hypercortisolism leading to obesity, hypertension, and glucose intolerance.  
- **Adrenal insufficiency**: hypocortisolism causing fatigue, hypotension, and adrenal crisis.  
- **Glucocorticoid resistance**: diminished `GR` signaling associated with metabolic syndrome and autoimmune disorders.  
- **Bone health**: chronic excess contributes to osteoporosis.

#### Clinical Biomarkers (Optional)
- Plasma free cortisol, salivary cortisol (diurnal curve), 24‑hour urinary free cortisol, and late‑night salivary cortisol.

#### Therapeutic Relevance (Optional)
- Synthetic glucocorticoids (`dexamethasone`, `betamethasone`) exploit `cortisol`’s anti‑inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties; dose and duration are guided by measured cortisol levels.
