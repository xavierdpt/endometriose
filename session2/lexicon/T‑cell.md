**Title:** T‑cell  

T‑cells are a central component of adaptive immunity, originating from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and maturing in the thymus. They recognize processed antigenic peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules through their T‑cell receptors (TCRs) and orchestrate immune responses via cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity. T‑cell dysfunction or dysregulation underlies a broad spectrum of immunologic diseases, including autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and transplant rejection.  

### 2. Location & Context  
- Found primarily in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes, thymus) and peripheral tissues (skin, gut, lung).  
- Expressed on the plasma membrane; TCRs form heterodimers of α/β or γ/δ chains.

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- **Subsets:** CD4⁺ helper T‑cells, CD8⁺ cytotoxic T‑cells, regulatory T‑cells (Tregs), γδ T‑cells, memory T‑cells, naïve T‑cells.  
- **Key domains:** TCR variable (V) domain, constant (C) domain, CD3 complex (γ, δ, ε, ζ chains) for signal transduction.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- **Antigen recognition:** TCR binds peptide–MHC complexes with specificity for pathogen or self‑antigens.  
- **Signal transduction:** Initiates activation cascade (Lck, ZAP‑70 → LAT, PLCγ1 → Ca²⁺, PKCθ → NF‑κB/ERK).  
- **Effector actions:** Helper T‑cells secrete cytokines (IL‑2, IFN‑γ), cytotoxic T‑cells induce apoptosis of infected or malignant cells, Tregs suppress immune activation.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- **Splice variants:** CD4 isoforms (CD4‑1, CD4‑2, CD4‑3).  
- **Post‑translational modifications:** Glycosylation of TCRβ chain, phosphorylation of CD3ζ ITAMs during activation.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- T‑cells primarily rely on glycolysis during activation; memory T‑cells favor fatty‑acid oxidation.  
- Key metabolic enzymes: hexokinase, PKM2, CPT1A.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **Receptors:** TCR (α/β or γ/δ), co‑receptors CD4/CD8, costimulatory molecules CD28, CTLA‑4, PD‑1.  
- **Mode of action:** Signal transduction via tyrosine kinase cascades → transcription factors NF‑AT, NF‑κB, AP‑1.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- In gut‑associated lymphoid tissue, intraepithelial γδ T‑cells respond to stress‑induced self‑peptides.  
- In skin, CD8⁺ resident memory T‑cells provide rapid protection against re‑infection.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Cytokines: IL‑2 (autocrine/paracrine), IL‑12 (drives Th1 differentiation), IL‑10 (suppressive).  
- Chemokine receptors (CCR7, CXCR3) guide migration to lymphoid organs and inflamed tissues.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- HLA‑DRB1 and HLA‑DQB1 alleles influence T‑cell antigen presentation and disease susceptibility (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis).  
- Polymorphisms in **CTLA4** and **PDCD1** genes modulate T‑cell exhaustion and autoimmunity risk.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- Short‑chain fatty acids from fiber fermentation enhance Treg differentiation.  
- Vitamin D status modulates T‑cell cytokine profiles.  
- Chronic infections (e.g., CMV) alter T‑cell repertoire and senescence.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Autoimmune diseases:** Type 1 diabetes (CD8⁺ β‑cell killing), multiple sclerosis (T‑cell mediated demyelination).  
- **Immunodeficiencies:** Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) involves defective T‑cell development.  
- **Transplantation:** T‑cell‑mediated graft‑versus‑host disease; checkpoint blockade can induce T‑cell–driven adverse events.

**Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests**  
- Flow cytometric analysis of CD4⁺/CD8⁺ ratios, TCR Vβ repertoire sequencing.  

**Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting**  
- Anti‑CD3 monoclonal antibodies (OKT3), checkpoint inhibitors (anti‑PD‑1, anti‑CTLA‑4) modulate T‑cell activity.  
- Adoptive T‑cell therapies (CAR‑T, TCR‑engineered T cells) exploit T‑cell effector functions for cancer treatment.
