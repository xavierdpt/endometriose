IL‑8 is a small, cysteine‑rich chemokine (encoded by the *CXCL8* gene) that functions as a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils. It is secreted by a variety of cell types in response to inflammatory stimuli and orchestrates acute inflammatory responses by guiding neutrophils to sites of infection or tissue injury. Elevated IL‑8 levels are a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.

### 2. Location & Context
- Cytokine secreted into the extracellular space, accumulating in plasma and interstitial fluid.  
- Expressed by epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, and certain tumor cells.  
- Concentrations range from 1–10 pg mL⁻¹ under basal conditions to > 1 ng mL⁻¹ during acute inflammation.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- Member of the CXC chemokine sub‑family; motif `ELR+` (Glu‑Leu‑Arg) adjacent to the first cysteine.  
- Mature protein of 72–77 amino acids; forms a non‑covalently linked dimer via disulfide bonds.  
- Contains a characteristic four‑helix bundle architecture.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Primary role: chemoattraction of neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils.  
- Induces neutrophil degranulation, ROS production, and activation of the endothelial adhesion cascade.  
- Modulates angiogenesis through endothelial cell proliferation and migration.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Two major isoforms: `CXCL8-α` (72 aa) and `CXCL8-β` (77 aa).  
- Post‑translational modifications include N‑terminal processing, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding, and proteolytic cleavage by neutrophil serine proteases.

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized in the cytoplasm and secreted via the classical ER–Golgi pathway.  
- Degraded by proteases such as proteinase‑3, neutrophil elastase, and plasma protease nexin‑1.  
- Clearance occurs through renal excretion and uptake by macrophages.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Binds the G‑protein–coupled receptors `CXCR1` and `CXCR2`.  
- Activation triggers PLC‑β, PKC, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways, leading to chemotaxis, integrin activation, and survival signals.  
- GAGs on endothelial surfaces present IL‑8 to receptors, forming a gradient.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- In pulmonary epithelium: recruits neutrophils during bacterial pneumonia.  
- In vascular endothelium: promotes leukocyte adhesion and vascular permeability.  
- In tumors: supports angiogenesis and tumor cell migration.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Synergizes with IL‑1β, TNF‑α, and LPS‑induced signaling to amplify inflammatory gene expression.  
- Forms complexes with CXCL1, CXCL5, and other ELR⁺ CXC chemokines.  
- Interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in certain contexts, modulating T‑cell trafficking.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- Promoter SNPs at positions −251 T → C and +781 G → A alter transcriptional activity and are linked to susceptibility to COPD, asthma, and certain cancers.  
- Rare loss‑of‑function variants in *CXCR1* or *CXCR2* impair neutrophil recruitment and predispose to recurrent infections.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω‑3) down‑regulate IL‑8 expression via NF‑κB inhibition.  
- Cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust, and particulate matter up‑regulate IL‑8 through oxidative stress pathways.  
- Dietary antioxidants (vitamin C, β‑carotene) modestly reduce IL‑8 levels in inflammatory states.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Elevated IL‑8 is a biomarker of acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and severe asthma.  
- Persistent IL‑8 signaling contributes to tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance.  
- Targeting IL‑8 or its receptors is under investigation for controlling chronic inflammation and improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes.
