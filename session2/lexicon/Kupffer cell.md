**Kupffer Cell**

Kupffer cells are specialized macrophages that populate the liver sinusoids, forming a crucial component of the innate immune system and liver homeostasis. They clear pathogens, senescent cells, and debris, while secreting cytokines that shape immune responses and tissue repair. Their activity is tightly regulated by liver‑specific signals and systemic factors.

## 2. Location & Context
- Resident in the hepatic sinusoidal lumen of each liver lobule.  
- High abundance: ~10⁶ cells per gram of liver; express markers `CD68`, `F4/80`, and `MARCO`.  

## 3. Classification & Structure
- Belongs to the mononuclear phagocyte system; a liver‑specific macrophage phenotype.  
- Key surface receptors: scavenger receptor `SR‑A`, `MARCO`, Toll‑like receptor `TLR4`.  

## 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- Phagocytose bacteria, apoptotic cells, and circulating debris.  
- Produce cytokines (`TNF‑α`, `IL‑10`, `TGF‑β`) that regulate inflammation, fibrosis, and regeneration.  

## 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- Express MHC class II (`HLA‑DR`) and the mannose receptor `CD206`.  
- Secretion of soluble CD163 and ferritin as functional markers of activation.  

## 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Engulfed material is degraded in lysosomes; oxidative burst generates reactive oxygen species.  
- Engages iron metabolism via transferrin receptor, releasing `heme` and producing `ferroxidase`.  

## 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- LPS binding to `TLR4`/`MD‑2` triggers MyD88‑dependent NF‑κB activation.  
- Engagement of `CD163` by hemoglobin‑haptoglobin complexes dampens inflammation via STAT3.  

## 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- Liver‑specific: recycle iron, secrete `hepcidin`‑influencing hepatic iron export.  
- Promote hepatocyte proliferation during partial hepatectomy.  

## 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Crosstalk with cytokines: `IL‑1β`, `IL‑6`, `IFN‑γ` modulate activation state.  
- Interaction with hepatic stellate cells via `TGF‑β` and `PDGF`, influencing fibrosis.  

## 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- `TLR4` Asp299Gly polymorphism increases susceptibility to septic shock.  
- Variants in `CSF1R` may alter Kupffer cell survival and contribute to liver disease progression.  

## 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Chronic alcohol consumption activates Kupffer cells via `TLR4`, driving NASH and fibrosis.  
- High‑fat diet induces metabolic endotoxemia, stimulating Kupffer‑cell inflammatory pathways.  

## 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- Central role in alcoholic liver disease, non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis, viral hepatitis, and hepatic fibrosis.  
- Overactivation contributes to systemic inflammation in sepsis and chronic liver injury.  

### Clinical Biomarkers
- Serum soluble `CD163`, ferritin, and liver enzymes (`ALT`, `AST`) correlate with Kupffer‑cell activation.  

### Therapeutic Relevance
- CSF1R inhibitors (e.g., `PLX3397`) reduce Kupffer‑cell numbers and attenuate fibrosis in preclinical models.  
- TLR4 antagonists (e.g., `Eritoran`) aim to mitigate Kupffer‑cell‑mediated inflammation in sepsis and NASH.
