**Cytokine**  
Cytokines are a broad class of low‑molecular‑weight signaling proteins produced by many cell types, including immune, endothelial, and epithelial cells. They mediate intercellular communication in innate and adaptive immunity, regulating inflammation, cell growth, differentiation, and tissue repair. Their dysregulation is implicated in a range of diseases from autoimmunity to cancer.

### 2. Location & Context
- Secreted into the extracellular space or present on the cell surface.  
- Concentrations vary from picomolar to nanomolar in plasma, depending on the cytokine and physiological state.

### 3. Classification & Structure
- **Families**: interleukins (IL), interferons (IFN), tumor necrosis factors (TNF), colony‑stimulating factors (CSF), chemokines, growth factors, and others.  
- **Structural motifs**: many contain a four‑helix bundle (IL‑2, IFN‑γ) or a β‑sheet sandwich (TNF‑α), while chemokines possess a cysteine‑rich motif.

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function
- **Immune regulation**: activate, recruit, or suppress immune cells (e.g., IL‑2 promotes T‑cell proliferation; IL‑10 dampens inflammation).  
- **Cellular differentiation**: GM‑CSF stimulates myeloid lineage expansion; TGF‑β drives fibroblast activation.  
- **Barrier and repair**: IL‑17 and IL‑22 support epithelial integrity and wound healing.

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives
- **Alternative splicing** yields soluble and membrane‑bound isoforms (e.g., IL‑2Rα variants).  
- **Post‑translational modifications**: glycosylation, proteolytic cleavage (TNF‑α conversion by TACE), and sulfation (chemokines).

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation
- Synthesized on the rough ER, processed in the Golgi, and secreted via exocytosis.  
- Degraded extracellularly by proteases (e.g., MMP‑9 degrades CXCL8) or internalized by receptor‑mediated endocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling
- Bind to specific receptor complexes (e.g., IL‑6 binds to gp130/IL‑6Rα).  
- Trigger JAK/STAT, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and NF‑κB pathways, leading to transcriptional reprogramming.

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions
- **Lung**: IL‑13 promotes mucus hypersecretion; IL‑5 drives eosinophil recruitment.  
- **Brain**: IL‑1β modulates microglial activation; IL‑6 influences neurogenesis.  
- **Gut**: IL‑22 supports epithelial barrier integrity; IL‑17 recruits neutrophils.

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules
- Synergize with chemokines (e.g., IL‑1β upregulates CXCL8).  
- Modulate hormone levels (e.g., TNF‑α induces insulin resistance).  
- Influence transcription factors such as NF‑κB and AP‑1.

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants
- SNPs in cytokine genes (e.g., IL‑6 –174 G > C) affect serum levels and disease susceptibility.  
- Copy‑number variations in IFN genes are linked to antiviral responses.

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences
- Omega‑3 fatty acids and curcumin downregulate pro‑inflammatory cytokines (TNF‑α, IL‑1β).  
- Smoking and air pollution elevate IL‑8 and IL‑6 production.  
- Probiotic bacteria can modulate IL‑10 and IL‑12 levels.

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations
- **Autoimmune diseases**: elevated IL‑17 and IL‑23 in psoriasis; increased IFN‑α in systemic lupus erythematosus.  
- **Chronic inflammation**: high IL‑6 and TNF‑α contribute to rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis.  
- **Cancer**: IL‑10 and TGF‑β foster immune evasion; IL‑6 promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis.  
- **Sepsis**: cytokine storm characterized by massive release of IL‑1β, IL‑6, and TNF‑α leads to multi‑organ failure.
