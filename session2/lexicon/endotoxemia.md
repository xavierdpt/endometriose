**Endotoxemia** is the systemic presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram‑negative cell walls, in the bloodstream. It triggers a potent innate immune response and can progress to sepsis or septic shock if uncontrolled. The condition is central to many infectious and inflammatory diseases and is a major focus of therapeutic research.

### 2. Location & Context  
- Circulating in the plasma/serum following bacterial translocation or direct inoculation.  
- Concentrations typically range from < 1 ng mL⁻¹ (baseline) to > 100 ng mL⁻¹ during severe infection.  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
- **Classification**: Endotoxin, a potent PAMP (pathogen‑associated molecular pattern).  
- **Structure**: Tri‑domain LPS consists of lipid A (endotoxic activity), a core oligosaccharide, and an O‑antigen polysaccharide.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
- Acts as an alarm signal to activate innate immunity.  
- Induces cytokine release (TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6) and upregulates coagulation pathways.  

### 5. Molecular/Structural Derivatives  
- Modified lipid A variants (e.g., 4‑phosphoryl‑lipid A) with altered potency.  
- Endotoxin‑binding proteins such as LBP (lipopolysaccharide‑binding protein) and sCD14 stabilize LPS for receptor presentation.  

### 6. Metabolism & Biotransformation  
- **Removal**: Hepatic Kupffer cells phagocytose LPS; detoxified via lipocalin‑2 and cholesterol‑binding proteins.  
- **Degradation**: LPS can be hydrolyzed by phospholipases (e.g., PLA₂) and amidases.  

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
- **Primary receptor complex**: `TLR4`/`MD-2` complex, activated by LPS–LBP–sCD14 binding.  
- **Cascade**: MyD88‑dependent NF‑κB activation → pro‑inflammatory cytokine transcription; TRIF‑dependent IRF3 activation → type‑I interferons.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
- **Endothelium**: Upregulates adhesion molecules (ICAM‑1, VCAM‑1), increasing leukocyte recruitment.  
- **Hepatocytes**: Induce acute‑phase proteins (CRP, serum amyloid A).  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
- Binds to high‑density lipoprotein (HDL) via SR-BI, mitigating toxicity.  
- Interacts with endotoxin‑neutralizing agents (polymyxin B, polymyxin derivatives).  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
- `TLR4` Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms reduce LPS responsiveness and are linked to altered sepsis outcomes.  
- Variants in `MD-2` or `CD14` influence susceptibility to endotoxemia.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
- **Diet**: High‑fat meals increase LPS translocation (metabolic endotoxemia).  
- **Environment**: Exposure to Gram‑negative bacterial contamination (e.g., food spoilage, waterborne pathogens) elevates risk.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
- **Clinical features**: Fever, hypotension, tachycardia, organ dysfunction (acute kidney injury, ARDS).  
- **Biomarkers**: Serum LPS levels, LBP, sCD14, cytokine panels (TNF‑α, IL‑6).  

### Optional Sections  

#### Clinical biomarkers / diagnostic tests  
- Endotoxin activity assays (Limulus amebocyte lysate test).  
- Plasma LPS quantification by mass spectrometry or ELISA.  

#### Therapeutic relevance / drug targeting  
- Polymyxin B adsorption columns in severe sepsis.  
- TLR4 antagonists (e.g., eritoran) and monoclonal antibodies against CD14.  
- Anti‑cytokine therapies (anti‑TNF‑α, IL‑1 receptor antagonist).  

#### Molecular pathways  
- TLR4/MyD88/NF‑κB axis.  
- TLR4/TRIF/IRF3 axis.
