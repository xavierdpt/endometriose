**Leaky Gut (Intestinal Hyperpermeability)**  
Leaky gut is a pathological state in which the intestinal epithelial barrier becomes compromised, allowing luminal antigens, bacteria, and toxins to cross into the lamina propria and systemic circulation. This aberrant permeability is implicated in a wide range of inflammatory, autoimmune, and metabolic disorders. Understanding its mechanisms is essential for developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.  

### 1. Introductory Summary  
Leaky gut denotes increased intestinal epithelial permeability that disrupts the barrier between the gut lumen and host tissues. It contributes to chronic inflammation and disease by permitting translocation of microbial products and antigens. The condition is associated with conditions such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic syndrome.  

### 2. Location & Context  
The dysfunction occurs in the intestinal epithelium, particularly at tight junction complexes in the jejunum and ileum. Barrier integrity is normally maintained by tight junction proteins (e.g., claudins, occludin, ZO‑1). Leaky gut is characterized by a measurable increase in paracellular flux across this mucosal layer.  

### 3. Classification & Structure  
Leaky gut is classified as an intestinal permeability disorder rather than a single disease entity. It is often considered a pre‑clinical state that can underlie or exacerbate multiple disorders.  

### 4. Physiological / Biological Function  
Under normal conditions, the intestinal barrier selectively permits nutrient absorption while excluding harmful luminal substances. In leaky gut, this selective permeability is lost, leading to mucosal immune activation, systemic inflammation, and dysbiosis.

### 7. Receptor Binding & Signaling  
Not applicable.  

### 8. Tissue‑Specific Actions  
In the gut, increased permeability activates innate immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) and adaptive lymphocytes, promoting pro‑inflammatory cytokine production. Systemically, translocated bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can trigger Toll‑like receptor signaling in liver, adipose, and vascular tissues.  

### 9. Interaction with Other Biomolecules  
Leaky gut facilitates translocation of bacterial products (e.g., LPS), food antigens, and endotoxins, which interact with pattern‑recognition receptors (TLR4, NOD‑like receptors) and stimulate NF‑κB and MAPK pathways. This crosstalk amplifies inflammatory cascades.  

### 10. Genetic Polymorphisms & Variants  
SNPs in tight junction genes such as `CLDN14`, `OCLN`, and `CLDN15` are associated with increased permeability. Variants in immune‑regulatory genes (e.g., `IL23R`, `NOD2`, `TNFAIP3`) also contribute to susceptibility.  

### 11. Dietary & Environmental Influences  
Gluten, alcohol, NSAIDs, high‑fat diets, and chronic stress can disrupt tight junction integrity. Short‑chain fatty acid deficiency (e.g., butyrate) due to dysbiosis further weakens barrier function.  

### 12. Pathophysiological Associations  
Leaky gut is implicated in celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, food allergies, systemic autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), metabolic syndrome, and neuroinflammatory conditions.
