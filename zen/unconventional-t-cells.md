# Unconventional T Cells

Unconventional T Cells recognize non-classical antigens and bridge innate and adaptive immunity through rapid responses and specialized recognition mechanisms.

**Note on classification**: Unlike conventional αβ T cells that recognize peptide antigens presented on classical MHC molecules, unconventional T cells use alternative recognition systems including γδ T cell receptors, CD1-restricted lipid recognition, and MR1-restricted metabolite detection, allowing them to respond rapidly to diverse molecular patterns associated with infection, stress, or metabolic disturbance.

## Gamma Delta (γδ) T Cells

Gamma delta T cells bridge innate and adaptive immunity by rapidly responding to stress signals and pathogen-associated molecular patterns without requiring classical antigen processing and presentation.

γδ T cells accomplish this through their unique T cell receptor composed of gamma and delta chains that can directly recognize stressed cells, phospholipids, and microbial metabolites, while also expressing pattern recognition receptors that detect danger signals.

These cells respond rapidly to tissue damage by recognizing stress-induced ligands like MICA/MICB and heat shock proteins expressed on stressed epithelial cells, while also detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as bacterial phosphoantigens and viral components.

Upon activation, γδ T cells secrete diverse cytokines including IFN-γ for antimicrobial responses, IL-17 for neutrophil recruitment, and IL-4 for tissue repair, while also providing direct cytotoxicity through perforin and granzyme release.

This coordinated response creates a rapid first-line defense that combines innate-like recognition speed with adaptive-like memory formation, making γδ T cells particularly important at epithelial barriers where they constitute a significant portion of tissue-resident lymphocytes and provide immediate protection against infection and malignancy.

## Natural Killer T (NKT) Cells

Natural killer T cells recognize lipid antigens presented on CD1d molecules and rapidly produce large quantities of cytokines to shape both innate and adaptive immune responses, serving as immunoregulatory cells that can promote either tolerance or inflammation depending on the antigenic context.

NKT cells accomplish this through their semi-invariant T cell receptor that specifically recognizes glycolipid antigens like α-galactosylceramide presented on the non-classical MHC molecule CD1d, which is expressed on antigen-presenting cells and some epithelial cells.

Upon TCR engagement, NKT cells rapidly produce both Th1-type cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α for antimicrobial and anti-tumor responses, and Th2-type cytokines like IL-4 and IL-13 that can promote regulatory responses and prevent excessive inflammation.

These cells also produce IL-17 in certain inflammatory contexts, while their interaction with dendritic cells through CD40-CD40L enhances dendritic cell maturation and cross-presentation capabilities, amplifying both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.

This coordinated cytokine production creates a rapid immunomodulatory response that can enhance protective immunity against intracellular pathogens and tumors through Th1 bias, promote tolerance and prevent autoimmunity through Th2 cytokines and regulatory cell induction, and bridge innate and adaptive immunity by activating dendritic cells and other immune cells within hours of antigen encounter.

## Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) Cells

Mucosal-associated invariant T cells detect bacterial metabolites and provide rapid antimicrobial responses at mucosal surfaces, serving as sentinel cells that recognize vitamin B metabolites produced by bacteria and some yeasts through the MR1 presentation pathway.

MAIT cells accomplish this through their semi-invariant T cell receptor that specifically recognizes microbial vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and B9 (folate) metabolites presented on the non-classical MHC molecule MR1, which is highly conserved across species and expressed on epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells.

Upon recognition of bacterial metabolites like 5-OP-RU (5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil), MAIT cells rapidly produce antimicrobial cytokines including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17, while also releasing cytotoxic granules containing perforin, granzyme B, and granulysin.

These cells can also respond to inflammatory cytokines like IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 in a TCR-independent manner, allowing them to participate in broader inflammatory responses beyond direct microbial detection.

This coordinated response creates rapid antimicrobial defense specifically targeting bacteria and fungi that synthesize riboflavin, provides direct cytotoxic killing of infected cells through degranulation, and enhances barrier immunity at mucosal sites where MAIT cells are highly abundant, making them particularly important for protection against respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.
