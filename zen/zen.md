T cells are white blood cells that mature in the thymus and play a crucial role in adaptive immunity by recognizing specific antigens and coordinating targeted immune responses.

# Immune System Overview

T cells are part of the adaptive immune system and work alongside other immune cells to protect the body from pathogens and maintain immune homeostasis.

B cells are another key component of adaptive immunity that produce antibodies and provide humoral immune responses. Unlike T cells, which recognize peptide antigens presented on MHC molecules, B cells can directly recognize native antigens through their B cell receptors and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete specific antibodies.

Macrophages are innate immune cells that serve as antigen-presenting cells and phagocytes. They engulf pathogens, process antigens, and present them to T cells via MHC class II molecules. Macrophages also produce inflammatory mediators and coordinate immune responses at sites of infection or tissue damage. For comprehensive information about macrophages including their creation, destruction, activation mechanisms, cellular processing, and similarities to the digestive system, see: [Macrophages: Comprehensive Overview](macrophages.md)

Dendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. They capture antigens in peripheral tissues, migrate to lymphoid organs, and present processed antigens to naive T cells to initiate adaptive immune responses.

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that provide rapid responses against infected or malignant cells without requiring prior antigen exposure. They recognize stressed cells through activating and inhibitory receptors and can directly kill target cells or coordinate immune responses through cytokine production.

Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells and serve as first responders to infection. These granulocytes rapidly migrate to sites of inflammation, engulf pathogens through phagocytosis, and release antimicrobial substances including neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).

Eosinophils are granulocytes primarily involved in defense against parasitic infections and allergic reactions. They release toxic granules containing enzymes and proteins that can damage parasites and contribute to tissue inflammation in allergic conditions.

Basophils are the least common granulocytes that play key roles in allergic reactions and immune responses to parasites. They release histamine and other inflammatory mediators, contributing to immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

Monocytes are circulating precursors to tissue macrophages and dendritic cells. Upon entering tissues, they differentiate into various specialized cell types depending on local environmental signals and tissue-specific requirements.

Mast cells are tissue-resident immune cells strategically located at barrier sites like skin and mucosal surfaces. They rapidly release inflammatory mediators including histamine, cytokines, and chemokines in response to allergens, pathogens, or tissue damage.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident lymphocytes that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. They respond rapidly to cytokines and tissue signals, producing effector cytokines that coordinate immune responses and maintain tissue homeostasis.

Plasma cells are the antibody-producing effector form of B cells. After activation and differentiation, plasma cells secrete large quantities of specific antibodies that neutralize pathogens and mark them for elimination by other immune cells.

Memory B cells are long-lived B cells that persist after initial antigen exposure and provide rapid, enhanced antibody responses upon re-encounter with the same antigen, forming the basis of immunological memory for humoral immunity.

# T Cell Classification

T cells can be classified into several major categories:

## CD4+ and CD8+ Designations

The CD4+ and CD8+ designations refer to surface proteins called Cluster of Differentiation (CD) molecules. CD4 and CD8 are glycoproteins that serve as co-receptors and help T cells interact with other immune cells. The numbers (4 and 8) come from the systematic CD classification system where surface markers were numbered as they were discovered and characterized. The "+" sign indicates that the cells express (are positive for) these specific surface proteins, while CD4- or CD8- would indicate their absence.

## CD4+ Helper T Cells

## CD8+ T Cells

For detailed information about CD8+ T Cells and their subtypes (naive, effector, memory, exhausted, and regulatory CD8+ T cells), see: [CD8+ T Cells](cd8-t-cells.md)
