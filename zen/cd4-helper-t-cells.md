# CD4+ Helper T Cells

CD4+ Helper T Cells coordinate immune responses and include multiple subtypes.

**Note on nomenclature**: The Th numbering system (Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22) is not sequential because it reflects the historical order of discovery and naming rather than a planned numerical sequence. Numbers like Th3-Th8 were either never officially assigned to distinct subsets or represent abandoned nomenclature (e.g., "Th3" was once used for certain regulatory T cells but is no longer used). Later subsets were often numbered after their signature cytokines (Th9 for IL-9, Th17 for IL-17, Th22 for IL-22).

## Th1 Cells

Th1 cells promote cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens by activating macrophages and enhancing cytotoxic T cell responses.

Th1 cells accomplish this through the secretion of key cytokines, primarily interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).

IFN-γ activates macrophages by increasing their phagocytic activity, enhancing antigen presentation via upregulation of MHC class II molecules, and stimulating the production of antimicrobial substances like nitric oxide.

IL-2 promotes the proliferation and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, while TNF-α contributes to inflammatory responses and can directly kill infected cells.

This coordinated cytokine response creates a hostile environment for intracellular pathogens such as viruses, certain bacteria, and parasites.

## Th2 Cells

Th2 cells support humoral immunity and fight parasites by promoting B cell activation and antibody production, particularly against extracellular parasites like helminths.

Th2 cells accomplish this through the secretion of key cytokines, primarily interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and interleukin-13 (IL-13).

IL-4 promotes B cell class switching to produce IgE antibodies, which are crucial for allergic responses and antiparasitic immunity, while also inhibiting Th1 cell differentiation and macrophage activation.

IL-5 activates and recruits eosinophils, which are specialized white blood cells that release toxic granules to combat parasitic infections, while IL-13 stimulates mucus production and smooth muscle contraction in the airways and gut.

This coordinated cytokine response creates an environment optimized for expelling parasites through increased mucus secretion, smooth muscle contractions, and the recruitment of specialized effector cells like eosinophils and mast cells.

## Th9 Cells

Th9 cells produce IL-9 and are involved in protection against parasitic helminth infections, allergic responses, and anti-tumor immunity, serving as specialized effector cells that bridge type 2 immunity and tissue remodeling.

Th9 cells accomplish this through the secretion of their signature cytokine interleukin-9 (IL-9), along with other mediators including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-21 (IL-21).

IL-9 activates mast cells and enhances their degranulation, promotes mucus production by epithelial cells, and stimulates the proliferation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), while also supporting tissue repair processes and angiogenesis.

IL-10 provides regulatory functions by limiting excessive inflammation, while IL-21 can enhance B cell responses and support germinal center reactions for antibody production.

This coordinated cytokine response creates a specialized immune environment that effectively combats tissue-invasive helminths through enhanced barrier function, promotes wound healing and tissue remodeling, and can provide anti-tumor surveillance through mast cell activation and enhanced cytotoxic responses.

## Th17 Cells

Th17 cells defend against extracellular bacteria and fungi by recruiting neutrophils and promoting inflammatory responses at barrier sites, serving as crucial guardians of mucosal surfaces and epithelial barriers.

Th17 cells accomplish this through the secretion of key cytokines, primarily interleukin-17A (IL-17A), interleukin-17F (IL-17F), interleukin-21 (IL-21), and interleukin-22 (IL-22).

IL-17A and IL-17F stimulate epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages to produce neutrophil-attracting chemokines like CXCL1 and CXCL8, while also promoting the production of antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-α.

IL-22 enhances epithelial barrier function by promoting cell proliferation and survival, stimulating the production of antimicrobial proteins like RegIII and S100 proteins, while IL-21 supports the maintenance and expansion of Th17 cells themselves and enhances B cell responses.

This coordinated cytokine response creates a robust inflammatory environment that rapidly recruits neutrophils to sites of infection, strengthens epithelial barriers against pathogen invasion, and promotes tissue repair and regeneration following microbial challenges at mucosal surfaces.

## Th22 Cells

Th22 cells maintain epithelial barrier function by producing IL-22, which promotes tissue repair and antimicrobial peptide production, serving as specialized protectors of epithelial integrity at barrier sites like the skin, gut, and lungs.

Th22 cells accomplish this through the secretion of their signature cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22), along with other mediators including interleukin-13 (IL-13) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).

IL-22 stimulates epithelial cells to proliferate and migrate for wound healing, enhances the production of antimicrobial peptides such as RegIII proteins, S100 proteins, and defensins, while also promoting mucin production and tight junction integrity to strengthen barrier function.

IL-13 complements IL-22's effects by promoting mucus production and goblet cell hyperplasia, while TNF-α enhances local inflammatory responses and can stimulate epithelial cell activation and antimicrobial responses.

This coordinated cytokine response creates a protective environment that maintains epithelial barrier integrity, rapidly repairs tissue damage through enhanced cell proliferation and migration, and provides potent antimicrobial defense without causing excessive tissue-damaging inflammation at critical barrier sites.

## T Follicular Helper (Tfh) Cells

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells assist B cell responses in lymphoid organs by providing signals necessary for germinal center formation and antibody affinity maturation, serving as specialized coordinators that migrate to B cell follicles to orchestrate high-affinity antibody production.

Tfh cells accomplish this through the secretion of key cytokines, primarily interleukin-21 (IL-21), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and the chemokine CXCL13, while expressing crucial surface molecules like CXCR5, PD-1, and ICOS.

IL-21 promotes B cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation into plasma cells and memory B cells, while also supporting germinal center maintenance and antibody class switching, and IL-4 specifically drives class switching to IgG1 and IgE antibodies.

CXCL13 helps recruit additional B cells to germinal centers, while the surface molecules CXCR5 enables Tfh cells to migrate into B cell follicles, PD-1 regulates the duration and intensity of T-B cell interactions, and ICOS provides essential costimulatory signals for B cell activation.

This coordinated cytokine and surface molecule expression creates an optimal microenvironment for high-affinity antibody production through enhanced germinal center reactions, promotes long-lasting humoral immunity via memory B cell formation, and ensures precise regulation of B cell responses to prevent autoimmunity.
